This can also be written in terms of ‚Äúconical‚Äù limits in C.
In terms of homotopy type theory this heuristics becomes a theorem.
So the loops here are all built from two semi-ciricle paths.
Intuitively, the group structure comes from composition and inversion of loops.
In homotopy type theory, it is literally concatenation of paths.
Now consider Y‚ÜíX an object of C/X.
The definitiong of the right-hand commutative square above may not be obvious.
This comes canonically with its terminal global sections (‚àû,1)-geometric morphism (LConst‚ä£Œì):H‚ÜíŒì‚ÜêLConst‚àûGrpd.
In Top this is the usual topological circle.
In sSet Quillen the (‚àû,1)-pushout is computed by the homotopy pushout.
This we now come to.
This is discussed at (‚àû,1)-topos in the section Closed monoidal structure.
We spell out in detail what this action looks like.
The reader should thoughout keep the homotopy hypothesis-equivalence, (|‚àí|‚ä£Œ†):Top‚âÉ‚àûGrpd in mind.
This can happen only for n=n‚Ä≤, but then it happens for arbitrary ‚Ñì.
In other words we have Aut(B‚Ñ§)‚âÉ‚àê [n]‚àà‚Ñ§ √óB‚Ñ§. and Aut Id(B‚Ñ§)‚âÉB‚Ñ§.
In this model things look more like one might expect from a circle action.
Notice that B‚Ñ§ is the skeleton of Œ† 1(S 1).
Consider H= ‚àûGrpd, G a group and X=BG the delooping groupoid.
In particular, the categorical circle action is ‚Ñì:(g‚ÜíhAd hg)‚Ü¶(g‚Üíg ‚ÑìhAd hg).
The circle acton on ‚ÑíX induces differentials on these.
For instance G could be GL(n) itself and this morphism the identity.
This generalises the above example of ‚ÑíBG.
In higher differential geometry, geometry is paired with homotopy theory.
This section lists examples of how higher differential geometry helps with understanding plain differential geometry.
The textbook (Moerdijk-Mrcun) discusses foliation theory from this perspective.
These are equivalently (Chevalley-Eilenberg algebras) of L-‚àû algebroids.
A subtopic of this is Poisson geometry, where the foliation is by symplectic leaves.
A fundamental problem in Poisson geometry was the deformation quantization of Poisson manifolds.
The classification of these structures in each case is infinitesimally given by deformation theory.
This is amplified in (Fiorenza-Martinengo2012).
Notably the moduli spaces arising in differential geometry tend to be orbifolds instead of manifolds.
But orbifolds are equivalently a proper √©tale Lie groupoid.
Maxwell's equations influenced the study of de Rham cohomology.
The category of smooth manifolds does not have many limits.
To a large extent, differential geometry had been co
evolving with the description of physics in terms of fields.
We indicate here some aspects.

The category ùí¶(ùíú) is sometimes called the ‚Äúhomotopy category of chain complexes‚Äù.
Therefore in homotopy theory it should behave entirely as the 0-complex itself.
But the above chain map is chain homotopic precisely only to itself.
This is the corresponding resolution of the original chain map.
This is the statement of this lemma at projective resolution.
The following definitions follow Mochizuki2004.

Noncommutative measure spaces are represented by noncommutative von Neumann algebras.

All these efforts belong to an early phase of noncommutative algebraic geometry.
Noncommutative analytic geometry is even now only vaguely outlined in existing works.
We can thus follow Durov in thinking of it as a generalized ring.
For example, all affine spaces are convex spaces as defined below.
This duality is functorial, and therefore is present for convex spaces for general P.
This leads to the notion of a dual convex space?.
The intended interpretation is that c p(x,y)=x+p(y‚àíx)=(1‚àíp)x+py.
In the unbiased version, any convex-linear combination is a linear combination.
In the unbiased version, any convex-linear combination is an affine linear combination.
This can be generalised to any (possibly unbounded) semilattice.
We may call a cancellative convex space an abstract convex set.
A lambda theory is a cartesian operad equiped with a semi-closed structure.
Moreover, we have that [Fin,Set](U n,U)‚âÖL(n) naturally in n.

Algebraic topology refers to the application of methods of algebra to problems in topology.
Therefore, the functorial method is very suitable to prove negative existence for morphisms.
The archetypical example is the classification of surfaces via their Euler characteristic.
This way algebraic topology makes use of tools of homological algebra.

Therefore classifying and counting instantons amounts to classifying and counting G-principal bundles.
This is the case of ‚ÄúBPST-instantons‚Äù.
This is the 4-sphere S 4‚âÉ‚Ñù 4‚à™{‚àû}.
We see below that Chern-Weil theory identifies this number with the instanton number.
Therefore this class completely characterizes SU(2)-principal bundles in 4d.
Constructing instantons from gauge transformations
Topologically this is homeomorphic to the situation before, and hence just as good.
Gauge fields vanishing at infinity
Now we bring in connections.
As discussed before, we may just as well consider any principal connection.
But beware that this is only true on a single chart.
Because the 4-form is gauge invariant.
Put this way this should be very obvious now.
That this is so is given to us by Chern-Weil theory.

In the following we try to illuminate what the article here is saying.
The following tries to illuminate a bit what‚Äôs going on .
So the idea is to axiomatize big toposes in which geometry may take place.
We walk through the main bits of the article:
Another axiom is that Œ† 0 preserves finite products.
This appears on page 6.
This is what Lawvere is talking about from the bottom of p. 6 on.
The downward functor that he mentions is Œì:‚Ñ∞‚ÜíùíÆ.
The left and right adjoint inclusions to this are Disc and coDisc.
Therefore there is an intrinsic notion of geometric paths in any cohesive ‚àû-topos.
In fact there is differential cohomology in every cohesive (‚àû,1)-topos.
Notice next that every adjoint triple induces an adjoint monad.
Then the isomorphism condition means that X has exactly one global point.
And so there is ‚àû-Lie theory canonically in every cohesive ‚àû-topos.
More discussion of all this is at differential cohomology in a cohesive topos.

Banach coalgebras (or cogebras) are like Banach algebras, but coalgebras.
The dual of a Banach coalgebra is a Banach algebra (but not conversely).
We can also consider Banach bialgebras (or bigebras).
(Recall that a Banach algebra is a monoid object in Ban.)
Technically, we've defined a counital coassociative Banach coalgebra.
Then we have a cocommutative Banach coalgebra.
Then A‚äï 1K is a counital Banach coalgebra.
Warning: the term ‚Äòhomomorphism‚Äô is used more generally; see below.
In this way, BanCoalg becomes a symmetric monoidal category.

This reproduces the more classical form of the axiom of choice.
An equivalent statement is that every object is internally projective.
We call this the internal axiom of choice.
Often, however, this is the more relevant notion to consider.
The following characterization can be found in Freyd-Scedrov (1990, p.181)
A Grothendieck topos satisfies the internal axiom of choice iff it is a Boolean √©tendue.
In particular, satisfaction of IAC entails Booleanness.

See at Diaconescu-Goodman-Myhill theorem.
CC states that the set ‚Ñï of natural numbers is projective.
Intuitively, this says that the failure of AC is parametrized by a single set.
It apparently follows from SVC, at least in ZF.
The small cardinality selection axiom is another similar axiom.
The axiom of choice can also be strengthened in a few ways.
(Making this precise requires a bit of work.)
These assumptions leads to a very nice setting for analysis called dream mathematics.
The existence of a Reinhardt cardinal contradicts AC.
These are stronger axioms as n increases.

The notion of cokernel is dual to that of kernel.
A cokernel in a category ùíû is a kernel in the opposite category ùíû op.

The following lists some common procedures that are known as categorification.
See also categorification in representation theory.
In a way, the very notion of counting is about this.
This point is made nicely in BaDo98.
In such diagrammatic incarnation, these definitions may be internalized into other categories.
For instance a group internal to Diff is a Lie group.
But similarly one can also internalize in categories of higher categories.
Then a group internal to Cat is a strict 2-group.
This is thought of as a notion of a categorified group.
But notice again how highly non-unique such categorification is.
One way to make this systematic is discussed below.
A general theory of this is described at geometric ‚àû-function theory.
Also geometric Langlands duality fits into this context.
These are infinity-categorified versions of the original structures.
Some people also speak of horizontal categorification as categorification.
This is to be distinguished from vertical categorification.
(Vertical) categorification can often be usefully decomposed into two operations.
Thus, this gives us groupoidal categorification, or homotopification.
This can also be understood naturally in the language of (n,r)-categories.

(Constructively, we require that x‚â∞y iff y‚àíx‚â∞0.)
Note that in this case, A is nontrivial iff 0#0 is false.

(In particular, the empty set is nondegenerate, for once.)
This new example never has a compatible group structure and is never nontrivial.
(Constructively, let x‚â∞y if x n‚â∞y n for some n.)
Then x<y means that x n<y n for every n.
The additive group structure is compatible, and A is nontrivial iff n>0.
Constructively, x‚â∞y means that y‚àíx is apart from u *u for all u.)

In old texts, strict 2-categories are occasionally called hypercategories.
2-categories provide the context for discussing adjunctions; monads.
2-categories form a 3-category, 2Cat.
This produces the classical notion of strict 2-category.
(This is the case for both strict 2-categories and bicategories.)
This happens to be a strict 2-category.
Every 2-groupoid is a 2-category.

This category sometimes arises in the study of gerbes.
Therefore, we can talk about categories enriched over Ho(Cat).

In particular, any bicategory has an underlying Ho(Cat)-category.
We choose monoid homomorphisms P‚Üí‚Ñ§/2 and P‚Üí‚Ñ§/3 representing f and g, respectively.
Let c 1 be such that f(c 1)=b.
If g(c 1) is not the identity, let c=c 1.
If f(c 2) is not the identity, then let c=c 2.
In either case, neither f(c) nor g(c) is the identity.
But the element œÉ conjugates i(g(c)) to j(f(c)), a contradiction.
There are various different notions of n-vector spaces.
For n=2 this is a Baez-Crans 2-vector space.

The Nullstellensatz fails as does the continuity principle.
In a topos with a connected subobject classifier Œ© itself is a connector.
Conversely the existence of a connector implies the connectedness of Œ©: Proposition
Let ‚Ñ∞ be weakly cohesive topos.
‚Ñ∞ has a connector T iff p !(Œ©)=1. Proof.
‚Äú‚áí‚Äù: Let 1‚áât 1t 0T be a connector.
Then t 1:1‚ÜíT is a subobject with characteristic map œá 1:T‚ÜíŒ©.
Consider the two composites œá 1‚àòt i , i=0,1:
For i=1 this simply yields true by the definition of œá 1.
Therefore œá 1‚àòt 0 classifies 0‚Üí1 which is exactly the definition of false.
In particular, f‚àº Ig implies p !(f)=p !(g).
‚ñ™ For the following the monoid structure of Œ© will become important.
So let us briefly review the basics:
The conjunction ‚àß is defined as the characteristic map of 1‚Üí‚ü®true,true‚ü©Œ©√óŒ©.
but this implies X=0 since it corresponds to the pullback of true and false.

‚ñ™ By prop. and the preceding the next is immediate: Corollary
Let ‚Ñ∞ be a weakly cohesive topos whose subobject classifier is a connector.
Theorem Let ‚Ñ∞ be a weakly cohesive topos.
Then the subobject classifier Œ© is connected iff Œ© is contractible.
The subobject classifier Œ©‚àà‚Ñ∞ is connected i.e. p !(Œ©)=1.

Note that such a homomorphism is necessarily a monotone function, but the converse fails.
Thus, a semilattice is a poset with property-like structure.
The category of semilattices Semilattices and semilattice homomorphims form a concrete category SemiLat.
By the remarks above, this is equivalent to the category of commutative idempotent monoids.
Conversely, any idempotent commutative monoid becomes a Bool-module in a unique way.
Thus, the category SemiLat is equivalent to the category of Bool-modules.
A downset is finitely generated if it is the union of finitely many principal downsets.

This is a subentry of sheaf about the plus-construction on presheaves.
For other constructions called plus construction, see there.
See this MathOverflow question for details.
This implies the existence of the adjoint quadruple as discussed here.
This argument is formalized in the HoTT/Coq library.
But here we formulate the argument externally and categorically.
The plus-construction is a well-pointed endofunctor.
This follows fairly formally from its identification with  É‚ôØ, the composite of two reflectors.
Lemma The plus-construction preserves finite limits.
Both functors r ! and s * preserve finite limits.
For A‚ààPsh(C), the following are equivalent: A is a sheaf.
The canonical map r *A‚Üís *A is an equivalence.
r *A is codiscrete.
Œ∑ A:A‚ÜíA + is an equivalence.
Œ∑ A:A‚ÜíA + has a retraction.
Of course if Œ∑ A is an equivalence, it has a retraction.
It follows that sheafification exists.
(Roughly this argument appears in Lurie, section 6.5.3.)
We will actually prove something slightly more general.
Thus A is a sheaf if and only if it is (‚àí2)-separated.
Thus, any n-truncated presheaf is n-separated.
The central auxiliary definition is:
So far everything has been very formal.
The base case n=‚àí1 is the previous lemma.
Thus, by induction (‚ñµf) + is (n‚àí1)-truncated.

This is the structure of a strict 2-category.
We have that CatCat‚âÉStr2Cat. is the category of strict 2-categories.
The inductive limit of this construction finally is the category of strict omega-categories.

Write ùí±Cat for the (‚àû,1)-category of ùí±-enriched (‚àû,1)-categories.

This is prop. in view of the presentation discussed below.
: every object is the (‚àû,1)-colimit over a diagram of globes.

Separating the sets and elements
This is the approach taken by structural set theories.
This permits a ‚Äúset of all sets‚Äù but still appears to avoid paradox.
Similar ‚Äúglobal‚Äù restrictions on logic were investigated by Fitch 1953, 69.
The second statement clearly implies the first.
This proves by contradiction that every irreducible closed subset is a singleton.
Conversely, generally the topological closure of every singleton is irreducible closed.
There are many examples of sober spaces which are not Hausdorff.
Any Hausdorff space is not only sober, but also T 1.

Suppose now that C has a symmetric monoidal structure.

The unit with respect to this monoidal structure is given by 1=(1,‚àÖ,‚àÖ,...).
Symmetric sequences are useful in defining operads (symmetric operads) in symmetric monoidal categories.

It remains to work out more examples and applications.
A supermanifold of dimension (p|q) is a space locally modeled on ‚Ñù p|q.
See also at signs in supergeometry.
This synthetic differential supergeometry is developed in (Carchedi-Roytenberg 12).
Here we notably need some Lie theory in the super context.
Discussion of the classical examples is in (Varadarajan 04, chapter 7.3).
The resulting Klein-Gordon equation describes the kinematics of spinless scalar particles.
The pair (V,Q) will be called a quadratic vector space.
Equivalently I is the ideal generated by elements x‚äóx‚àíQ(x)‚ãÖ1.
Since I is not homogeneous, this grading does not descend to the quotient.
The following theorem is the key to all structural results about Clifford algebras.
Note that tensor products are taken in the category of superalgebras.
Moreover, we have dim(Cl(V,Q))=2 dim(V).
We drop the quadratic forms from the notation and just sketch the proof.
Therefore it extends to an algebra homomorphism Cl(V‚äïV‚Ä≤)‚ÜíCl(V)‚äóCl(V‚Ä≤).
By induction we obtain the formula for the dimension of Cl(V,Q).
Therefore it descends to a surjective map Cl(V,‚àíQ)‚ÜíCl(V,Q).
Since both sides have the same dimension, it is an isomorphism.
We denote Cl(V,Q) by ‚ÑÇl(V) in this case.
By induction we then have ‚ÑÇl(‚ÑÇ 2m)‚âÖ‚ÑÇl(‚ÑÇ 2m‚àí2)‚äó‚ÑÇl(‚ÑÇ 2).
The odd dimensional case is similar.
The structure of the real Clifford algebras is dictated by the super Brauer group.
A superalgebra is called a super division algebra if all nonzero homogeneous elements are invertible.
We will write CS superalgebra for short.
The following is proven in Varadarajan 04, Theorem 6.4.1.
The super Brauer group sBr(‚Ñù) is isomorphic to ‚Ñ§/8‚Ñ§.
Let D ‚Ñù=‚Ñù[œµ] be the superalgebra with œµ odd and œµ 2=1.
Let (V,Q) be a quadratic vector space.
We have Cl(r,s) +‚âÖCl(r,s‚àí1) as ungraded algebras.
Therefore we can read off the spin representations from the above classification table.
Consider for example the group Spin(3,1)‚äÇCl(3,1) +‚âÖCl(3,0)‚âÖM 2(‚ÑÇ).
This has two simple modules as a real algebra, ‚ÑÇ 2 and its conjugate.
We know what ùî§ 0 and ùî§ 1 should be in our case.
Therefore we need to concentrate on invariant symmetric forms Œ∫.
This can be found in Varadarajan 04, Table 6.4.
Let V be a complex vector space.
Moreover, observe that Œõ r(V)‚âÖŒõ d‚àír(V).
The proof for the odd dimensional case is similar.
This time the results are much more complex in the real case.
The case most important for us, however, is that of Minkowski signature.
Therefore here we first recall the classification and properties of spin representations in general.
This allows to form the super Poincar√© Lie algebra in each of these cases.
See there and see Spinor bilinear forms below for more.
Accordingly one can ask for the Lie algebra cohomology of super Minkowski spacetime.
This we come to below.
This is the (2,1)-topos of smooth groupoids/smooth (moduli) stacks.

Generally, we will regard the objects of C as contexts in a type theory.
So far, we do not assume anything about C as a category.
In this way, we obtain: Lemma
(These are, however, quite different as subcategories of CompCat.)
, then the functor E‚ÜíC I is determined by a universal property.
Let Fam denote the category of families of sets.
This is a category with attributes.
These constructions are inverses up to isomorphism.
The representability models the extension of a context with a new typed variable.
For any Œì‚ààC and A‚ààE Œì, we have ‚Ñì(Œì.A)=‚Ñì(Œì)+1.
Here we summarize some basic known constructions.
However, first we should mention the examples that come from type theory itself.
The syntactic category of any dependent type theory has all of the above structures.
The strict associativity of substitution in type theory makes this fibration automatically split.
There are standard constructions which can replace any Grothendieck fibration by an equivalent split fibration.
So, for the record, we have in particular: Example
Suppose given a particular morphism p:UÀú‚ÜíU in C.
We are thus treating U as a ‚Äúuniverse‚Äù of types.
We may then of course pass to a contextual category, via example .
This construction is due to Voevodsky.
The resulting display maps are those with ‚ÄúU-small fibers‚Äù.
The resulting display maps are the split opfibrations with small fibers.
Define the functor E‚ÜíC I to take (Œì,A) to the projection Œì√óA‚ÜíŒì.
It is straightforward to check that this defines a category with attributes.
The corresponding (split) full comprehension category is called the simple fibration of C.
First one defines a model category Lcc of lcc sketches.
These marked diagrams do not need to satisfy the corresponding universal property, however.
Thus sLcc supports substitutions that preserve type formers up to equality.
An algebraically cofibrant object of sLcc is a coalgebra for a fixed cofibrant replacement comonad.
A 2-categorical treatment of variant kinds of comprehension category is given in

Either of these may be considered a Tychonoff theorem for locales.
Let {U i‚äÇX√óY} i‚ààI be an open cover of the product space.
We need to show that this has a finite subcover.
Consider then the disjoint union of all these index sets K‚âî‚äîi‚ààIK i.
This is homeomorphic to the abstract point space *.
and there is thus a homeomorphism of the form {x}√óY‚âÉY.
This characterization allows an elementary proof of the general Tychonoff theorem, see there.
This proof is due to (Chernoff 92).
This in turn is equivalently the case if every net has a cluster point.
We will show that this is the case for the product of compact spaces.
We need to show that this has a cluster point.
Equip this with the partial order ‚â§ given by the evident extension of domains.
To this end we invoke Zorn's lemma.
Hence we may conclude by showing that c is indeed a partial cluster point.
One method of proof uses ultrafilter convergence.
This is sometimes called ‚ÄúBourbaki‚Äôs proof‚Äù, following Cartan 37.
Let ‚ü®X Œ±‚ü© Œ±‚ààA be a family of compact spaces.
(Consider the collection of all closed sets belonging to U Œ±.
Let x Œ± be a point belonging to that intersection.
Let U be an ultrafilter on ‚àè Œ±X Œ±.
Choose a point x Œ± to which U Œ± converges.
Using notation explained just below, this can expressed as follows
These observations give rise to the following question.
This is done by judicious choice of examples.
Let Y Œ± be obtained by adjoining a point p to X Œ±.
Then Y Œ± is compact; assuming Tychonoff, Y=‚àè Œ±Y Œ± is compact.
Hence ‚àè Œ±X Œ±=‚ãÇ Œ±K Œ± is nonempty as well, by compactness.
Thus the axiom of choice follows.
We are in the case where the external space is just a point.
This simple example captures the analogy with ordinary frame fields.
The situation with regard to colimits is more complicated.
(See Ad√°mek & Koubek, III.10, for an example when C= Pos.)
In this article we collect various results that guarantee existence of colimits of algebras.
A simple but basic fact is the following.
Under these hypotheses, U:C T‚ÜíC creates colimits over J.
Here are some sample applications of this proposition which arise frequently in practice.
A colimit over J is called a reflexive coequalizer.
The following very useful observation was first made by Linton.
It is enough to show that Set T has coequalizers.
(This requires the axiom of choice.
The proof is completed by the following lemma.
A split coequalizer is an absolute colimit, which the functor T preserves.
Categories of algebras are Barr exact Theorem
For regularity, we first construct coequalizers of kernel pairs in C T.
Thus kernel pairs in C T have coequalizers.
It is the coequalizer of its kernel pair œÄ 1,œÄ 2:E‚áâB.
Thus Up is a regular epi in C.
Thus regular epis in C T are stable under pullback.
It is the kernel pair of its coequalizer q in C.
If T is a monad on Vect, then Vect T is exact.
Details may be found in Locally presentable and accessible categories.

This completes the proof of the claim.
The tangle hypothesis (Baez and Dolan 95) is as follows:

Let R be a discrete integral domain.
We say that an element r‚ààR is a unit if it is invertible.
The ring of (rational) integers ‚Ñ§ is a UFD.
A principal ideal domain (PID) is a UFD.
(In particular, a Euclidean domain is a UFD.)
As a partial converse, a Dedekind domain that is a UFD is a PID.
If R is a UFD, then so is any localization S ‚àí1R.
If R is not integrally closed, then it is not a UFD.
As noted above, a UFD is necessarily integrally closed.
The lattice of principal ideals under the inclusion order is a distributive lattice.

Similar comments apply to the various other model structures below.
See Bousfield2003, section 4.4.
Let A be an abelian category with enough injective objects.
This follows an analogous proof in (Jardine 97).
We spell out a proof of the model structure below in a sequence of lemmas.
For n=0 let ‚Ñ§[‚àí1,0]=0, for convenience.
Let p:A‚Üí‚âÉB be degreewise surjective and an isomorphism on cohomology.
But in degree 0 this means that f 0(1)=0.
And so the unique possible lift in the above diagram does exist.
Consider now ‚Ñ§[n]‚Üí‚Ñ§[n‚àí1,n] for n‚â•1.
Since p is degreewise onto, there is a‚Ä≤ with p(a‚Ä≤)=b.
Choosing this the above becomes p(a)=p(z)‚àíg n‚àí1(1)+p(d Aa‚Ä≤).
Finally consider 0‚Üí‚Ñ§[n] for all n.
Set then œÉ:=a‚àíd Aa‚Ä≤.
For n=0 this is trivial.
Such exists because p is degreewise surjctive by assumption.
So assume f has the RLP.
In particular this means it is surjective in cohomology.
Apply the small object argument-reasoning to the maps in J={0‚Üí‚Ñ§[n‚àí1,n]}.
Since for n‚àà‚Ñï a morphism ‚Ñ§[n,n+1]‚ÜíB corresponds to an element b‚ààB n.
The map p is manifestly degreewise onto and hence a fibration.
This series of lemmas establishes the claimed model structure on Ch + ‚Ä¢(Ab).
the cofibrations are exactly the monomorphisms.
This proves the first statement.
a short proof is given in Strickland (2020), Prop. 25.
This is Hovey (1999), Thm. 2.3.13.
Let ùíú be an abelian category with all limits and colimits.
The cofibrations, fibrations and weak equivalences all depend on the projective class.
This is theorem 2.2 in Christensen-Hovey.
We shall write Ch(ùíú) ùí´ for this model category structure.
Let R be an associative ring and ùíú=RMod.
The ùí´-model structure on Ch(ùíú) has as fibrations the degreewise surjections.
Let ùíú be a Grothendieck abelian category.
A third approach is due to Cisinski-Deglise.
Let ùíú be a Grothendieck abelian category.
Now one defines a model structure associated to any such descent structure.
We call this the ùí¢-model structure on Ch(ùíú).
As in Gillespie‚Äôs approach we can sometimes get a monoidal model structure.
We refer to Cisinski-Deglise for the notion of a weakly flat descent structure.
Then the ùí¢-model structure is further monoidal.
Model categories of chain complexes tend to be proper model categories.
Proposition (pushout along degreewise injections presrves quasi-isomorphism)
Then also g is a quasi-isomorphism.
Let ùíú and ‚Ñ¨ be abelian categories.
Every functor preserves split epimorphism.
Hence L preserves all cofibrations and R all fibrations.
Let ùíú= Ab be the category of abelian groups.
See cohomology for more on this.
We discuss cofibrations in the model structures on unbounded complexes.
This appears as (ChristensenHovey, lemma 2.4).
This appears as (ChristensenHovey, prop. 2.5).
For R any ring, there is the Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum HR.

Let F be a functor from connective E ‚àû-ring spectra to spaces s.t.
Hence E‚Ä≤ is represented by DM-stack (M,O‚Ä≤).
Recall the map A‚ÜíœÑ ‚â•0A to the connected cover.
We need the following to prove the claim.
So we have F:Mod flat(œÑ ‚â•0A)‚ÜîMod flat(A):G.
Recall that a preorientation determines a map Œ≤:œâ‚ÜíœÄ 2(O‚Ä≤).
This formula comes from a much simpler situation‚Ä¶
(M,O) classifies oriented elliptic curve.
Suppose (1) and (2) hold.
Let f:SpecR‚ÜíM 1,1 be etale for R discrete.
We must show that O(SpecR) is an elliptic cohomology theory associated to f.
We must show that SpfA 0(‚ÑÇP ‚àû)‚âÉE^ f which follows from having an orientation.

We wish to show that œÄ nO=0 for n odd.
That M:=p iim(f k)=0 is equivalent to M‚äó RR/m for all m‚ààR.
The structure sheaf of O‚Ä≤ took values in connected E ‚àû-rings.
For instance, the constant sheaf ‚Ñ§ pÃ≤ is a p-divisible group.
Let A be an E ‚àû-ring.
We have a derived version of the Serre-Tate theorem.
Let ‚Ñë:R‚àíalg‚ÜíAb and ‚Ñë I(A):=ker(‚Ñë(A)‚Üí‚Ñë(A/I‚ãÖA).
Further, define ‚Ñë¬Ø(A):=ker(‚Ñë(A)‚Üí‚Ñë(A/nilR‚ãÖA))‚äÇ‚Ñë I(A).
Let R be a ring with p nilpotent and I‚äÇR a nilpotent ideal.

Let R be a commutative ring.
A polynomial with coefficients in R is an element of a polynomial ring over R.
Finally, sometimes ‚Äúpolynomial‚Äù is construed to mean a polynomial function.
This is actually just a particular instantiation of a definable operation.
A polynomial is constant if its degree is 0.
Polynomial rings on one generator also have the structure of a differential algebra.
Thus the univariate polynomial ring R[z] is a differential algebra.
This carries also a ring structure, with ring multiplication induced from the monoid multiplication.
A far-reaching generalization of this construction is given at distributive law.
The elements of this component are called homogeneous polynomials of degree n.
Using R-linearity, this is directly seen to yield the desired bijection.
This is a special case of the more general notion of Tall-Wraith monoid.
Let R be a commutative ring.
If deg(f)<deg(g), then q=0 and r=f will serve.
If k is field, then k[x] is a Euclidean domain.
See Euclidean domain for a proof.
This observation may be exploited in various neat ways.
The derivative of p may be defined to be q(x,x)‚ààk[x].
The non-invertible elements in a weak local ring form an ideal.
Therefore, ùíû covers X, so it has a finite subcover U i.
Stable closure implies compactness
The converse statement requires more ingenuity to prove.
Clearly such W are closed under arbitrary unions.
Now consider the set E={(x,U)‚ààX√óY:x‚ààU}.

There is also a notion of special lambda-ring.
The name derives from the common symbol Œõ n for the nth exterior power.
Hence Œª-rings are one incarnation of the representation theory of the symmetric groups.
Typically one can form direct sums of representations of some algebraic structure.
But nobody likes commutative monoids: we all have an urge to subtract.
In many situations, we can also take tensor products of representations.
Then the Grothendieck group becomes something better than an abelian group.
It becomes a ring: the representation ring.
If we start with a braided monoidal abelian category, this ring is commutative.
This category is very important in representation theory.
The irreducible objects in this category are called ‚ÄòYoung diagrams‚Äô.
Elements of the free Œª-ring on one generator are called symmetric functions.
L gives rise to a comonad on CRing.
R is in this case called a Œª-ring.

Idea Lie algebra cohomology is the intrinsic notion of cohomology of Lie algebras.
There is a precise sense in which Lie algebras ùî§ are infinitesimal Lie groups.

Sometimes it may also refer to the subject of derived noncommutative algebraic geometry.
There are several motivations for the study of derived algebraic geometry.
The word stems from the use of ‚Äúderived‚Äù as in derived functor.
This came from the study of derived moduli problem.

Let see what are the smallest commutative boolean rigs
The only boolean rig of cardinal 1 is the zero ring 0.
There are exactly two boolean rings of cardinal 2.
The two elements of the boolean rings are thus 0 and 1.
We then have two possibilities for 1+1, either 0 or 1.
The two possibilities give a boolean rig.
Homotopy type theory is a 2-theory defined in this 3-theory.
Here the first four 3-theories are ordered in terms of increasing expressivity.
Let us begin by describing the link group.
Milnor‚Äôs alternative description is as follows.
The link group is the group of equivalence classes of such loops.
A more practical description is the following.
Let L be a link in an open 3-manifold M.
Let G(L) be the fundamental group of the complement of L.
Let L i denote the sublink obtained by deleting the ith component of L.
Let E(L)=[A 1][A 2]‚ãØ[A n]. This is a normal subgroup of G(L).
The quotient, ùí¢(L)‚âîG(L)/E(L) is the link group of L.
These are the meridians and the parallels.
Choose orientations of the ambient manifold, M, and of the circle.
The ith meridian of L is the element Œ± i‚ààùí¢(L) defined as follows.
Choose a small neighbourhood N of p(1).
Then return to x 0 along p.
The subgroup ùíú i is the kernel of the homomorphism ùí¢(L)‚Üíùí¢(L i).
Go along p to its end.
Then go around the image of L i according to the orientation of the circle.
Finally return to x 0 along p.
Let f, f‚Ä≤ be closed loops in the complement of L.
Let L be an n-component Brunnian link.
Then we consider the element Œ≤‚Ä≤ n‚ààùí¢(L n) corresponding to the nth parallel.
The homotopy class of L is completely specified by these integers.
There was nothing special about the choice of components.
A similar procedure works for any pair of components.
Let us expand on the definition of the Œº-invariants.
We start with the exponential notation.
Let Jùí¢(L) be the integral group ring of ùí¢(L).
We write the kernel of Jùí¢(L)‚ÜíJùí¢(L i) as ùí¶ i(L).
Now let us suppose that L is trivial.
A canonical sentence is a sum or difference of any number of canonical words.
Sorting them out by permutation, we get the expression in (1).
Now, how do we interpret or calculate these invariants?
Consider a canonical word, k i 1‚ãØk i n‚àí2.
The corresponding element is: Œ± n‚àí1 k i 1‚ãØk i n‚àí2
Let us write Œ±=Œ± n‚àí1.
Now Œ± k 1 is Œ± a 1‚àí1=a 1Œ±a 1 ‚àí1Œ± ‚àí1.
So the general method is as follows: choose two components of the link.
Write one of them as a word in the meridians of the others.

Of course, finite limits are preserved by all three completions.
However, the inclusion functors do not preserve coequalizers.
In fact, the objects of C are precisely the projective objects of these categories.
A similar argument applies to the reg/lex completion.
Note that Top reg/lex is called the category of equilogical spaces.
On the other hand, some properties are not preserved by the completions.

There are two different ways of thinking of topological notions on Fr√∂licher spaces.
However, this would definitely be a theorem.
Let us start by defining the two functors to topological spaces.
As it is an inductive topology, the curvaceous topology has the following characterisation.
That is, these sets form a subbasis? for the topology.
Using the structure of the functionals, we can strengthen that.
Let (X,C X,F X) be a Fr√∂licher space.
Thus let U‚äÜX be open and p‚ààU.
Then the composition g‚àòf has the required properties.
Let us start with some very simple definitions.
A Fr√∂licher space is said to be discrete if all functions are smooth.
Hence all curves are smooth.
The discrete case is similar.
A Fr√∂licher space is said to be functionally Hausdorff if the smooth functions separate points.
However, the distinction is not important as the following lemma shows.
Suppose that (X,C,F) is not functionally Hausdorff.
Then œï‚àòŒ± is constant for all œï‚ààF so Œ±‚ààC.
However, Œ± has finite image but is not constant.
Thus (X,C,F) is not curvaceously Hausdorff.
Then there is some Œ±‚ààC with finite image which is not constant.
Then œï‚àòŒ± has finite image in ‚Ñù and hence is constant.
If a Fr√∂licher space is Hausdorff then smooth functions separate points.
Thus for x‚â†y‚ààX, there is a smooth function œï‚ààF with œï(x)=‚àí1 and œï(y)=1.
Suppose that X with the curvaceous topology is Hausdorff.
In light of this, we shall refer to just Hausdorff Fr√∂licher spaces.
Just as with topological spaces, there is a ‚ÄúHausdorffification‚Äù functor.
Unlike topological spaces, this functor is split.
Let (X,C,F) be a Fr√∂licher space.
The natural map X‚ÜíY is a quotient mapping in the category of Fr√∂licher spaces.
It is split, but not canonically so.
However, any two splittings are related by a diffeomorphism on X.
The smooth curves are then defined by the saturation condition.
That this is a quotient is straightforward.
This also establishes the necessary adjunction.
Finally, let us look at the splitting.
For each point in Y choose a representative of the equivalence class.
This choice defines a map on the underlying sets Y‚ÜíX.
The fibres of the Hausdorffification are straightforward to identify.
Let X be a Fr√∂licher space, Y its Hausdorffification.
For y‚ààY, let X y be the corresponding fibre.
Let Œ±:‚Ñù‚ÜíX y be an arbitrary curve.
Then for œï‚ààF X, as imŒ±‚äÜX y, œï‚àòŒ± is constant.
Conversely, let Z‚äÜX be a subset that inherits an indiscrete structure from X.
This is then smooth in X so for all œï‚ààF X, œï(x)=œï(y).
Hence Z is contained in a (unique) fibre of the quotient map X‚ÜíY.
Our next definition may be a little surprising at first.
A Fr√∂licher space is said to be regular if the curvaceous and functional topologies agree.
It is straightforward to see what one version of compactness should be.
A Fr√∂licher space is functionally compact if every smooth function has bounded image.
For the converse, assume that the functional topology is not compact.
We claim that it is possible to modify these to have disjoint support.
This is done recursively using postcomposition by suitably chosen functions.
Once this is done, we can define a new smooth function by ‚àënœï n^.
This is smooth, as the components have disjoint support, and is unbounded.
Hence the Fr√∂licher space is not functionally compact.
Thus the Fr√∂licher space is regular.
The property needed is about open sets in the product ‚Ñù√óX.
For Fr√∂licher spaces, this property is equivalent to sequential compactness.
Let X be a Fr√∂licher space.
Suppose that X is sequentially compact.
Let U‚äÜ‚Ñù√óX be a subset containing {0}√óX.
Hence U is not open.
Conversely, assume that neighbourhoods of {0}√óX contain slices as claimed.
That is, c ‚àí1(U) is not open in ‚Ñù.
Another obvious topological property is connectedness.
Here it is obvious what the two definitions should be.
follows from the fact that piecewise smooth curves can be reparametrised to smooth curves.
The notions of functionally connected and curvaceously connected coincide.
Let (X,C,F) be a Fr√∂licher space.
To do this, let X‚Ä≤‚äÜX be a curvaceously connected component of X.
Thus œï‚àòŒ± is a constant function.
Hence the two notions are the same.
The category of Hausdorff Fr√∂licher spaces is thus complete and co-complete.
Do I need to prove this, or is it automatic?
(I can prove it if necessary)
Mike: Completeness and cocompleteness are of course automatic.
Both seem quite simple, not sure which is the simplest.
We shall not give the inclusion functors special symbols but trust to context to distinguish.
Let ùîâ:I‚Üí‚Ñ≥ be a functor where I is a small category.
Its underlying set is (naturally isomorphic to) ‚Ñ±(*,X 0).
Composing with the Œ≤ i defines maps Œ≤ ix:*‚Üíùîâ.
Hence the underlying sets of M 0 and X 0 are the same.
The smooth curves of X 0 are the morphisms ‚Ñù‚ÜíX 0.
Note that this is in ‚Ñ± not ‚Ñã.
This morphism factors uniquely through the Hausdorffification of X 1.
Firstly, let us show that ŒΩ is surjective on underlying sets.
To see this, suppose for a contradiction that it is not.
Let x‚àà|M 1| be a point not in the image of ŒΩ.
Let N=M 1Ôπ®{x}.
Hence X 1‚ÜíM 1 is surjective.
We also have that the smooth functions on X 1 factor through M 1.
Thus let x,y be distinct points in the Hausdorffification of X 1.
There is thus a smooth function on X 1 which distinguishes them.
Thus the inclusion functor ‚Ñ≥‚Üí‚Ñã preserves colimits.
Does the inclusion into Fr√∂licher spaces then preserve colimits?
Let X be the real line with a double point at the origin.
Take a curve ‚Ñù‚ÜíX which oscillates between the two points.
This is a morphism into the Fr√∂licher space, but not into the manifold.

The notion of a building relies heavily on that of a Coxeter group.
Then there are currently three different viewpoints of thinking about a building.
The three viewpoints are distinguished by how one thinks about chambers.
In Tits‚Äô original approach, a building is a simplicial complex satisfying additional axioms.
Note that this is not a firmly established term in the literature.
This more modern approach originated with
Chambers are elements of an abstract set - more is not needed in the definition.

In type theory the unit type is the type with a unique term.
It is the special case of a product type with no factors.
In a model by categorical semantics, this is a terminal object.
In set theory, it is a singleton.
The formation rule for the unit type is given by ŒìctxŒì‚ä¢ùüôtype
the introduction rule for the unit type is given by ŒìctxŒì‚ä¢*:ùüô
The positive unit type says that ùüô satisfies singleton induction.
Thus, the unit type satisfies singleton induction.
Thus, the unit type is a contractible type.
The positive unit type is a contractible type.
We define it as f(œÄ 1(p S))‚âîœÄ 1(p T).
Thus, f is an equivalence of types between the contractible types S and T.
The positive and negative unit types are equivalent to each other.
We inductively define the type family x:ùüô‚ä¢El ùüô(x)type by defining El ùüô(*)‚âîùüô
Thus the univalence axiom for ùüô is true.
This makes the unit type into a Tarski universe representing a finite regular cardinal.
This makes the unit type into a Tarski universe representing a finite inaccessible cardinal.
The Œ≤-reduction rule is simple.
The positive presentation of the unit type is naturally expressed as an inductive type.
(Coq then implements beta-reduction, but not eta-reduction.
However, there is an Œ∑-conversion rule.
Namely: The negative unit type corresponds to a terminal object in a category

This entry is about the notion of ‚Äúcrystal‚Äù in algebraic geometry.
For the notion in solid state physics see at crystal.
There are few mutually unrelated notions denoted by ‚Äúcrystal‚Äù in mathematics.
One can of course talk about mathematical models of physical crystals and their geometry.
Finally, there are crystals due Grothendieck to which this entry is dedicated.
Grothendieck‚Äòs differential calculus is based on the infinitesimal thickenings of a diagonal of a space.
If one takes a completion, then there is a filtration on infinitesimals there.
Infinitesimal version of flat connection in algebraic geometry is a Grothendieck connection.
There is a site (the crystalline site) which formalizes these descent data.
But Grothendieck considered not only descent for quasicoherent sheaves but also for affine schemes.
Moreover this has also a crystalline version: crystals of affine schemes.
One has also analytic version (analytic D-spaces).
One can do more general crystals, e.g. of affine schemes.
(In other words, transfinite unions are van Kampen colimits.)
One may obtain various weaker notions by restricting the allowable values of Œ∫.
The category Set is easily verified to be exhaustive.
Thus, every Grothendieck topos is exhaustive.
We first prove the equivalence of the above two definitions.
Then C also satisfies the second condition above.
Exhaustiveness also interacts well with other exactness properties:
Colimits in an exhaustive category preserve finite limits.
But Œ∫ is a filtered category, so its diagonal functor is final.
In an exhaustive category, transfinite unions preserve monomorphisms.

Introducing Berger's theorem:
The empty space is the topological space with no points.
That is, it is the empty set equipped with its unique topology.
The empty space is the (strict) initial object in TopologicalSpaces.
However, in some ways these definitions are too naive.
Since hom(‚àÖ,‚àí) is constant at the point, it certainly does not preserve coproducts.

The signature of the theory consists of Various types A,B,C.
Function symbols of source 1 are also called constants.

First, for each type in the theory we choose an object of C.

Fundamental physics is all based on the gauge principle.
The simplest example of this is described in detail below in Gauge transformations in electromagnetism.
Such a structure is called a groupoid.
At least ordinary gauge fields do.
These ‚àû-groupoids are also called homotopy types.
This is what we discuss here.
Here we make this explicit for basic electromagnetism.
For more exposition and details along these lines see (Eggertson 14).
However, not all different gauge potentials describe different physics.
And it is not quite a smooth space itself, but a smooth groupoid:
One says that Œª induces a gauge transformation from A to A‚Ä≤.
We write Œª:A‚Üí‚âÉA‚Ä≤ to reflect this.
So the configuration space of electromagnetism does not just have points and coordinate systems.
But it turns out that this is too little information to correctly capture physics.
This is the discrete gauge groupoid for U-parameterized collections of fields.
It refines the gauge group, which is recoverd as its fundamental group:
We then also want to consider a smooth action groupoid.
We call them smooth groupoids.
But there is a further simplification at work.
For more on this see at geometry of physics ‚Äì coordinate systems.
Here we will freely assume familiarity with these.
The Yoneda lemma will turn this intuition into a theorem.
It also justifies dropping the extra underline denoting the Yoneda embedding.
A particular case of this of special importance is this: Example
There is then a unique composition operation.
. Let G be a Lie group and BG its groupoidal delooping according to example .
This is precisely the data of a G-valued Cech cohomology cocycle.
More along these lines is at geometry of physics ‚Äì principal bundles.
So a smooth groupoid is a stack on the site CartSp.
But this is equivalently the groupoid of G-principal bundles on ‚Ñù n.
Therefore this is an essentially surjective functor of groupoids.
Accordingly it is an equivalence of groupoids.
Put positively, this is the content of prop. . below.
This extends to a functor (D n) *:PreSmooth1Type‚ü∂Grpd
We write X‚ü∂‚âÉY for local weak equivalences of pre-smooth groupoids.
We will mostly just say weak equivalence for short.
This means that each of these connected components is equivalent to the point.
Hence this is a an equivalence of groupoids.
p is a weak equivalence, def. .
This is precisely the definition of differentialbly good open cover.
By prop. the object (BG) ‚Ä¢ satisfies descent on CartSp.
Choose {U i‚ÜíX} a differentiably good open cover.
This is equivalently the groupoid of G-principal bundles.
We need structures a bit richer than just bare ‚àû-groupoids.
In generalization to Lie groupoids, we need ‚àû-Lie groupoids.
This is equivalently a simplicial presheaf of sets.
These would-be invertible morphisms are called weak equivalences and denoted K 1‚Üí‚âÉK 2.
This is sometimes called an ‚àû-anafunctor from X to Y.
We give a more intrinsic characterization of differential 1-forms.

Let ùî§‚ààL ‚àû be an ordinary (finite dimensional) Lie algebra.
With G regarded as a smooth ‚àû-group write BG‚àà Smooth‚àûGrpd for its delooping.

This follows from the Steenrod-Wockel approximation theorem and the following observation.

Let Œª‚ààŒ© si,vert,cl n(Œî n+1).
Hence ‚à´ Œî ‚Ä¢ is indeed a chain map.
Inside the œµ-neighbourhoods of the corners it bends smoothly.
In that case there is an (n‚àí1)-form A with œâ=dA.
One way of achieving this is using Hodge theory.
Since the k-form œâ is exact its projection on harmonic forms vanishes.
This is the string Lie 2-group.
It‚Äôs construction in terms of integration by paths is due to (Henriques)
Let ùíú be an additive category.

We discuss the ingredients that go into this statement.
From here on, this page uses the implicit ‚àû-category theory convention.
Recall that colimits in Topos are calculated via limits on the level of underlying categories.
In particular, the copower of K by a groupoid A is the topos K A.
Therefore, we have Topos(Psh(A),H)‚âÉGPD(A,Topos(*,H))=GPD(A,Pt(H)), as desired.
Another way of phrasing the above argument is as follows.
Enlarging the category of toposes
Applied to a representable F=Topos(‚àí,H) this composite is hence A‚Ü¶Œì(H)(A).

This concept is the formal dual to internal groupoids in the opposite category of CRing.
As such they play a key role in the E-Adams spectral sequence.
But it may happen that they coincide:
Write ŒìCoMod for the resulting category of (left) comodules over Œì.
Analogously there are right comodules.
This establishes a natural bijection N‚ü∂fŒì‚äó ACN‚ü∂fÀúC and hence the adjunction in question.
The argument for the existence of cokernels proceeds formally dually.
Now by prop. we have the adjunction ŒìCoMod‚ä•‚ü∂forget‚üµco‚àífreeAMod.
See at Adams spectral sequence ‚Äì The second page.
Therefore it constitutes a co-free resolution of A in left Œì-comodules.
Therefore it computes the Ext-functor.
The Hopf algebroids appearing this way govern the corresponding E-Adams spectral sequences.
This is manifestly the case.
Now we may identify the commutative Hopf algebroids arising from flat commutative ring spectra.
This page considers Picard groupoids in themselves.
For the concept of Picard groupoid of a monoidal category, see there.
On this page, we shall, however, work with the fully strict notion.
Picard groupoids assemble into a strict 2-category.
Moreover, it is obvious that this category has all coproducts.
Thus it is an additive category.

Here we discuss some of these Ordinary (co)limits on resolved diagrams
This is sometimes called the Quillen formula for computing homotopy colimits.
Often, however, it is inconvenient to produce a resolution of a diagram.
One such way is the use of derived (co)ends, discussed below.
Let D be a small V-enriched category.
A general way of obtaining resolutions that compute homotopy (co)limits involves bar constructions.
We call this the natural or trivial homotopical structure on C.
For n=1 this is trivial.
For n=2 it is proven in (Gambino 10) (particularly section 6).
However, even this is not true for all types of homotopy limit.
An explicit proof that Ho(Cat) does not have pullbacks can be found here.
This is the tensor unit in the monoidal category [D op,sSet].
This is disucssed for instance in section 4 of (Gambino 10).

Let in the above general formula D={a‚Üêc‚Üíb} be the walking span.

(See for instance at Hecke category for an application.)
To see this, we again build a fibrant replacement of the pullback diagram.

Depending on a motivation one or another is more natural.
These maps restrict to set theoretic maps on the level of stalks. Comorphisms.
For example, consider the ring of smooth functions on a manifold.
Another example which does not fit into this first type would be the directed circle.
See in particular the book by Marco Grandis on Directed Algebraic Topology listed below.
Directed spaces are studied in directed homotopy theory, a relatively young topic.
See (n,r)-category for more on that.
Many other example can be found in the references.
The relation ‚â§ X for the whole space does not hold much information.
Every d-space gives rise to a stream.
The category of streams has good properties.
The category of compactly flowing streams is Cartesian closed.
Let V be an n-dimensional vector space with an inner product g.
The following structures on V are equivalent.
Note that n-framed patches are compact and contractible spaces.
Let X be a topological space.
Maps of framed spaces could be defined along the following lines.
Further references are given in directed homotopy theory.
Conversely, in a field, you can divide by anything except zero.
The characteristic of a field states when (if ever) this happens.
It is straightforward to generalise from fields to other rings, and even rigs.
This generator is the characteristic of K, denoted charK.
If K is a ring, then we do the same for a negative integer n.
The characteristic of a field must be either zero or a prime number.
In other words, any extension of a field keeps the same characteristic.
If n is a positive natural number, then the characteristic of ‚Ñï/n=‚Ñ§/n is n.
More generally, every finite field has positive prime characteristic.
Every ordered field has characteristic 0.
The real numbers and complex numbers each form fields of characteristic 0.
Let ùíû be a locally presentable (‚àû,1)-category.
This entry is about the concept in category theory.
For (co)exponential functions see at exponential map and coexponential map.
It generalises the notion of function set, which is an exponential object in Set.
The above is actually a complete definition, but here we spell it out.
(Usually, C actually has all binary products.)
It can also be characterized as a distributivity pullback.
As before, let C be a category and X,Y‚ààC.
If X Y exists, then we say that X exponentiates Y.
(This requires that C have all binary products.)
A cocartesian coclosed category has all of these (and an initial object).
Of course, in any cartesian closed category every object is exponentiable and exponentiating.
It sends numbers a,b‚àà‚Ñï to the product a b=a√óa√ó‚ãØ√óa(bfactors).
It yields for instance an exponentiation operation on the positive real numbers.
In particular, this includes locally compact Hausdorff spaces.
However, exponentiating objects do matter sometimes.
In Abstract Stone Duality, Sierpinski space is exponentiating.
Let ùíû be a category with finite limits and f:C‚ÜíD a morphism in ùíû.
In this case, we say that f is an exponentiable morphism in ùíû.
The exponentiable morphisms in Top were characterized by Niefield.
The exponentiable morphisms in Locale and Topos which are embeddings were also characterized by Niefield.
The exponentiable morphisms in Cat are the Conduch√© functors.
Thus, a product of exponentiable objects is exponentiable.
Now suppose that C is a distributive category.
Thus in a distributive category, the exponentiable objects are closed under coproducts.
This includes notably Vogt's theorem on the rectification of homotopy coherent diagrams.
This level of generality is sometimes convenient.
We state the concise functorial definition of diagrams of the shape of categories.

This is a non-finite commuting diagram.
This is where the term ‚ÄúBott element‚Äù comes from.

Writings Hermann Grassmann was a German polymath, 1809-1877.
The appreciation of Grassmann‚Äôs ideas took a long time:
For truth is eternal and divine.
The answer is as regretable as simple‚Äîit would not pay.
It is something that a respectable few seek to apply what they have already learnt.
Grassmann also had a profound influence on the thought of Gottlob Frege.
It allows classification of what would now be called ‚àû-bundles.
I didn‚Äôt pick that up.
It is not spelled out in detail in the paper.
What makes an open cover ‚Äònumerable‚Äô? ‚ÄîToby
A cover is numerable if it admits a subordinate partition of unity.
Numerable open covers form a site.
One could even ask for a subcategory of Top which is closed under some conditions.

By this Prop., see FSS 16, Section 3.
Being a left adjoint, F^ is cocontinuous.
This formula recurs frequently throughout this wiki; see also nerve, Day convolution.

See Day-Lack for more details on all these matters.
They handle the more general case of enriched categories.
Or should we think of it as part of a pseudoadjunction between 2-categories?
Equations between functors tends to hold only up to natural isomorphism.

(This text, by the way, contains various other gems.
These two items encode the topology and smooth structure.
This item encodes the Riemannian metric and possibly a connection.
Accordingly this is just the beginning of a pattern.
So this is the quantum mechanics of a superparticle.
And then there is the KO-dimension.
Traditionally spectral triples are discussed without specifying their homomorphisms.

A summary of this is in
One variation uses von Neumann algebras instead of C-star algebras.
In an open-closed QFT the cobordisms are allowed to have boundaries.
For a broader perspective see at brane.
But abstractly defined QFTs may arise from quantization of sigma models.
This gives these boundary data a geometric interpretation in some space.
This we discuss in the next section.
Particularly the A-model and the B-model are well understood.
There is also a mathematical structure called string topology with D-branes.
And typically these submanifolds themselves carry their own background gauge field data.
These may be quite far from having a direct interpretation as submanifolds of G.
See at Dirac structure for more on this.

As n ranges, these spaces form the Thom spectrum.

A differential form is a geometrical object on a manifold that can be integrated.

(Compare the notion of twisted form in a more general context.)
A Œ®-twisted form is called pseudoform.
Sometimes an n-form is itself called a density.
Urs, do you know where the need for orientation comes in here?
I think it is a good question.

See at pullback of differential forms.
See integration of differential forms for the general case.
I am not the most competent to do this succinctly enough‚Ä¶
Possibly that should go at differential forms on supermanifolds?
Ordinary differential forms on ORDINARY manifolds are the same as functions on odd tangent bundle.
I did not want to say anything about the generalization of differential forms on supermanifolds.
So it is NOT a different notion, but a different way to define it.
Then yes, that should be mentioned here too.
Notice that the terminology is slightly confusing: every topos is a coherent category.
Every coherent topos has enough points.
Often one means an infinite sequence, which is a sequence whose domain is infinite.
Sequences (especially finite ones) are often called lists in computer science.
The salient point is that i be cofinal as an embedding.
All of this applies in greater generality to families with index sets other than ‚Ñï.
Here one replaces the domain ‚Ñï by any arbitrary directed set.
In this case, we may want a slight generalisation that we call sequential nets.
Without WCC, however, this equivalence fails.
Sequence types also have their own extensionality principle, called sequence extensionality.
(Actually, these generalise quite nicely to net spaces.)
Let X be a smooth manifold.

This is what we discuss here.
This is what we discuss here.
We will be associating a fundamental p-brane with each invariant super L ‚àû-cocycle.
Computationally these correspond to certain identities satisfied by qadrilinear expressions in Majorana spinors.
These correspond to all the D-branes and to the M5-branes.
This we discuss in The super D-branes and the M5-brane
Next we descend these iterated central extensions to single but non-central higher cocycles.
This we discuss in Fields.
There turn out to be special relations among these.
Acordingly, this is now called the Green-Schwarz action functional.

The graphics on the left is from (Duff 87).
For detailed exposition see at Structure Theory for Higher WZW Terms.
There is considerably more information in A^ p than in its curvature curv(A^ p+1)=Œº p+2.
This phenomenon is indeed a consequence of the fundamental Green-Schwarz branes:
These solutions locally happen to have the same classification as the Green-Schwarz branes.
But rationally The brane bouquet allows to derive this from first principles:
We now explain all this in detail.
Externally this means the following: Proposition
We write sLieAlg for the resulting category of super Lie algebras.
This makes it immediate how to generalize to super L-infinity algebras:
Explicitly this means the following:
Let ùî§ be a super L-‚àû algebra.

The key observation for interpreting the following def. is this:
This is due to (FSS 12).
Establishing this is the only real work in prop. .
Hence ‚ô≠BG is the universal moduli stack for flat connections.
We find further characterization of this below in corollary , see remark .
This is no longer the case for general smooth ‚àû-groups G.
This we call the WZW term obtained by universal Lie integration from Œº.
Essentially this construction originates in (FSS 13).
Above we discussed how a single L-‚àû cocycle Lie integrates to a higher WZW term.
(The following statements are corollaries of FSS 13, section 5).
This follows with the recognition principle for L-‚àû homotopy fibers.
With this the statement follows by lemma .
Notice that extending along consecutive cocycles is like the extension stages in a Whitehead tower.
The homotopy limit over that last cospan, in turn, is G^Àú.
This implies the claim by the fact that homotopy limits commute with each other.
Corollary says that G^Àú is a bundle of moduli stacks for differential cohomology over GÀú.
This is by the discussion below.
Here we discuss how these may descend to single cocycles with richer coefficients.
This is explained in some detail at principal bundle ‚Äì In a (2,1)-topos.

This follows from the universality of colimits and the adjoint functor theorem.
For a locally presentable (‚àû,1)-category C, the following are equivalent.
C is locally cartesian closed.
(‚àû,1)-Colimits in C are stable under pullback.
C admits a presentation by a combinatorial locally cartesian closed model category.
C admits a presentation by a right proper Cisinski model category.
Since left adjoints preserve colimits, the first condition implies the second.
Suppose M is a right proper Cisinski model category.
Since left Quillen functors preserve homotopy colimits, the third condition implies the second.
The fifth condition implies the fourth, since the model structure therein is Cisinski.
It remains to show that the second condition implies the fifth.
For that, see this blog comment by Denis-Charles Cisinski.
This would be the ‚Äúinternal language‚Äù of C.
Some partial results in these directions are known.
Hence every presentable locally cartesian closed ‚àû-category interprets HoTT+FunExt.
This statement is not fully satisfactory for several reasons.
Firstly, it assumes local presentability.
Thus, the existence and behavior of a ‚Äúuniversal model‚Äù is unclear.
For related discussion see also at structure type and stuff type.
By fiat, declare F to be a forgetful functor.
However, notice that these two conditions violate the principle of equivalence for categories.

Property-like structure becomes much more prevalent for higher categories.
See also lax-idempotent 2-monad.
Note that property-like structure is known in traditional logic as categorical structure.
Obviously, this term can be confusing in categorial logic!
Accordingly the obvious functors to Set are faithful not full.
Hence it should remember stuff and structure but forget properties.
More interestingly, we can factor the forgetful functor Ab‚ÜíSet: Ab‚ÜíAb‚ÜíSet‚àñ{‚àÖ}‚ÜíSet
Here, the first part is trivial because Ab‚ÜíSet is faithful.
These operations are also invertible, up to equivalence.

An inequality space is a set with a strict inequality relation.
The last condition ensures that the type is an h-set.
By Hedberg's theorem, every type with an equivalence a#b‚âÉ(a= Tb)‚Üíùüò has decidable equality.
f is a strongly injective if f(x)#f(y) is logically equivalent to x#y.
Decidable strict inequality implies stable strict inequality, so it is usually called decidable inequality.
In the context of excluded middle, every strict inequality relation is decidable.
These monomorphisms are regular monomorphisms.
Similarly, it has all finite coproducts, and it has quotients of equivalence relations.
In fact, this category is a complete pretopos.
In classical mathematics, it is true that every set is an inequality space.
In constructive mathematics, however, not all sets are inequality spaces.
This implies axiom K and uniqueness of identity proofs.
Prime ideals are even more interesting.

There is no research we know of on AT categories.
Each of these assumptions obviously holds in any abelian category and in any pretopos.
The first 8 axioms are in fact universal Horn clauses in these predicates.
Here then are the AT exactness axioms.
Some of Freyd‚Äôs remarks in his original posting are included in parentheses.
The category is an effective regular category.
The arrow 0‚Üí1 is monic.
(‚ÄúNote that it follows that all maps from 0 are monic.‚Äù)
By axiom 2, the map 0‚Üí1 is monic.
The unique map 0‚Üí0√óX is monic since it has a retraction œÄ 1:0√óX‚Üí0.
Because we can take the pushout of a pair of monos 0‚ÜíX, 0‚ÜíY.
Proposition Coproducts are disjoint.
Category of type A objects is abelian
If X is of type A, then we clearly have X‚âÖ0√óX‚ÜíœÄ 10.
Conversely, suppose there exists p:X‚Üí0.
The full subcategory of type A objects is coreflective.
Thus the category of type A objects is comonadic.
Cokernels are defined dually, and can be formulated dually as certain pushouts.
Of course, 0 is a zero object in the category of type A objects.
Now suppose f:A‚ÜíC is an epi in the category of type A objects.
The category of type A objects is an abelian category.
See Freyd-Scedrov, Categories, Allegories, 1.598 (p. 95).
Category of type T objects is a pretopos
Now we show that the full subcategory of type T objects is a pretopos.
Type T objects are characterized by this property.
There is exactly one morphism A‚Üí0.
On the other hand, 0√óX is of type A since it projects to 0.
Thus X is of type T.
The initial object 0 is strict in the category of type T objects.
Hence T‚Üí0‚ÜíT is the identity, and of course so is 0‚ÜíT‚Üí0.
Proof Closure under products and subobjects is immediate from Lemma .
Closure under quotients and coproducts follows from axiom 4.
The full subcategory of objects of type T is a pretopos.
Corollary gives finite completeness, coproducts, and quotients of kernel pairs.
It follows that coproducts are universal in the category of T objects.
It is also effective regular by axiom 1, hence a pretopos.
Splitting into type A and type T objects
Hence the coreflector is a morphism of AT categories.
The functor F is faithful.
The functor F is left exact and therefore preserves kernels.
By axiom 8, F reflects isomorphisms.
It follows immediately from these two facts that F is faithful.

Let X be a uniform space.
With excluded middle, we can take C‚Ä≤ to be C.
Another class of spaces for which this holds are compact ones.
Let X be compact regular.
Furthermore, X√óX is also compact regular.
Let U be a neighborhood of the diagonal in X√óX.
Now, G is the union of rectangular open neighborhoods A√óB.
Note that since G is disjoint from the diagonal, any A√óB‚äÜG satisfies A‚à©B=‚àÖ.
It remains to show that the uniform topology on X is the original one.
Clearly if U is an entourage then each U[x] is a neighborhood of x.
For any x‚ààX, there is an entourage V such that V x[x]√óV x[x]‚äÜU.
Let W x be an entourage such that W x‚àòW x‚äÜV x.
Let W=W 1‚à©‚ãØ‚à©W k; we claim W‚äÜU.
Every uniformly regular uniform space is a regular topological space in its uniform topology.
For if x‚ââ Uz, let V‚àòV‚äÜU and ¬¨W‚à™V=X√óX.
Most of the axioms are obvious.
Thus, any uniform space gives rise to a uniform apartness space.

Linear logic deals with this by restricting our ability to duplicate or discard resources freely.
Linear logic is usually given in terms of sequent calculus.
Here we define the set of propositions:
Every propositional variable is a proposition.
However, the connectives and constants can also be grouped in different ways.
But on this page we will stick to Girard‚Äôs conventions for consistency.
Also, sometimes the additive connectives are called extensional and the multiplicatives intensional.
The additive connectives are also idempotent (but the multiplicative ones are not).
This equivalence relation A‚â° LambekB is strictly stronger than propositional equivalence.
It should be observed that all equivalences A‚â°B listed below are in fact Lambek equivalences.
The logical rules for negation can then be proved.
However, this approach is not as beautifully symmetric as the full sequent calculus.
The logic described above is full classical linear logic.
The sequents are also restricted to have only one formula on the right.
In this case all connectives are all independent of each other.
One can also consider adding additional rules to linear logic.
Another rule that is sometimes considered is the mix rule.
We discuss the categorical semantics of linear logic.

The following sections discuss classes of examples of twisted smooth structures in string theory.
This is to be read as an extended table of contents.
Explanations are in the sections to follow.
Let X be a smooth manifold of dimension n.
We write [(Œª ij)]‚ààH smooth 1(X,GL n).
We call this H the (2,1)-topos of smooth groupoids or of smooth stacks.
We may understand this inclusion geometrically in terms of the canonical metric on ‚Ñù n.
Now we can say what a Riemannian metric/orthogonal structure on X is:
The component E is the corresponding vielbein.
For more on this see also the discussion at general covariance.
It is a familiar fact that many fields in physics ‚Äúnaturally pull back‚Äù.

Above we have seen (pseudo-)Riemannian structure given by lifts through the inclusion BO(n)‚ÜíBGL(n).
Now we consider further lifts, through the Whitehead tower of BO.
This encodes higher spin structures.

This identifies BSO‚ÜíB 2‚Ñ§ as being an isomorphism on the second homotopy group.
To that end we first need a good model for bare homotopy types.
This classifies a smooth circle 2-bundle / bundle gerbe.
This is made precise as follows.
We call this the geometric realization of smooth ‚àû-groupoids.
We now apply this to the above Whitehead tower.
We say that B nU(1) conn is a differential refinement of B nU(1).
We indicate briefly how this is constructed.
We add some stacky aspects to that and explain why.
The first one is kinematics.
The second is dynamics, being the equations of motion of the system.
So there must be another way to refine dF=J mag to differential cohomology.
This underlies the discussion of flux quantization below.)
We say that F^ is a c^-twisted bundle with twisted curvature being F‚âîdA i+Œ≤ i.
The third one of these is related to the higher gauge anomalies proper.
The magnetic twist c^ will depend on other field configurations that induce magnetic charge.
So it is not a constant, but varies with the fields.
Eventually one wants to quantize such a setup.
Similarly for higher gauge theory it is the L-infinity algebroid.
So before getting to that special case, we indicate here the general pattern.
This perspective can be refined.
This also exhibits the smoothness of the action.
So there should be a cricle 3-bundle with connection on this moduli stack.
Indeed, it induces a whole tower of higher circle bundles, in each codimension:
Let J el be the Poincare dual form.
(Here is where we need J el to have compact support.)
This is the anomaly line bundle with connection on the moduli stack of fields.
The action functional needs to be a flat section of ‚àá totalanomaly.
Hence the two line bundles need to be inverse to each other.
This condition is the Green-Schwarz mechanism.
In the previous section we have considered higher differential structures originating in the orthogonal group.
Accordingly, the above Whitehead tower of BO has stage-wise unitary twistings.
For our purposes it is useful to think of this as follows.
To which we now turn.
So in general we say it is a œï-twisted such cocycle.
And that (h ij) classifies a œï-twisted unitary bundle.
In cohomology this says that [dd(œï ga)]=[œï B| Q]‚ààH 3(Q).
This is the Freed-Witten anomaly cancellation condition for general Q.
Measurable spaces are the traditional prelude to the general theory of measure and integration.
Measurable spaces and measurable functions form a category Meas, which is topological over Set.
Most of these are discussed at articles dedicated to them.
It's also essential to use almost functions to avoid a paucity of measurable functions.
Thus every set becomes a discrete measurable space.
However, what is (say) a Borel set in the real line?
This is difficult, if not impossible, to explain predicatively.
to define a Borel set we need to quantify over all countable ordinals.
I would be delighted to learn otherwise!
Instead of dealing with individual sets, we will deal with pairs of disjoint sets.

Then g is sent to 0 in E, hence g cannot be 1.
Any isomorphism E‚ÜíF restricts to an isomorphism E p‚ÜíF p.
So we are required to show that this inverse limit is inhabited.
We conclude from compactness that the full intersection ‚ãÇ p|qŒ¶ pq is inhabited.

The functor in the other direction associates to any category its internal logic.
Its objects are the contexts in the type theory;
Its morphisms between contexts are substitutions, or interpretations of variables.
If T has function types, then Con(T) is cartesian closed category.
If T has sum types, then Con(T) has binary coproducts.
If T is a regular theory, then Con(T) is a regular category.
If T is a coherent theory, then Con(T) is a coherent category.
If T is a geometric theory, then Con(T) is a geometric category.
One thing worth noting is that Con(T) always has finite products.
This is due to the objects of Con(T) being contexts rather than types.
A way to avoid this is to work instead with a syntactic cartesian multicategory.
There is no reason to keep variable names the same.

We define the coboundary ‚àÇœá by ‚àÇœá=(‚àè i=0 ievenŒî iœá)(‚àè i=1 ioddŒî iœá ‚àí1)
This formula is symbolically also written as ‚àÇœá=(‚àÇ +œá)(‚àÇ ‚àíœá ‚àí1).
An invertible œá‚ààB ‚äón is an n-cocycle if ‚àÇœá=1.
Counital 2-cocycle is hence the famous Drinfel'd twist.
The 3-cocycle condition for œï‚ààH ‚äó3 reads: (1‚äóœï)((id‚äóŒî‚äóid)œï)(œï‚äó1)=((id‚äóid‚äóŒî)œï)((Œî‚äóid‚äóid)œï)

The discussion in ordinary category theory above is the special case where ùí±:= Set.
The Cauchy completion of an ordinary category is its idempotent completion, or Karoubi envelope.
The Cauchy completion is the usual completion under Cauchy nets or Cauchy filters.

The Cauchy completion is the completion under finite direct sums and idempotent splitting.
When ùí±=Ch is chain complexes, a ùí±-category is a dg-category.
Cauchy complete dg-categories are characterized by Nikoliƒá, Street, and Tendas.
In the ‚àû-categorical context, we can consider enrichment in the ‚àû-category of spectra.
(The associativity and identity axioms are here superfluous since V is a poset.)
Recall also that module composition is defined by a coend formula for a tensor product.
In particular, representables themselves are points of the Cauchy completion.
They are called absolute limits for that reason.

But what is the formal reason?
The mismatch turns out to be the quantifiers used.
So there‚Äôs an extra (t‚ä©Comp) requirement making inclusion weaker than subtyping.
(This rule cannot be represented in HOAS style without some modal trick.
The motive needs to be generalized in order to handle binding forms.)
the (‚àÄt.(t‚ààA)type) part is too strong.
(Is there a better term for this?)
This is a running theme of this page.
This is discussed in later sections.
Subtyping was defined as: A<:B‚âî(Œªx.x)‚àà(A‚ÜíB)
Using the computation formation rules, we have (Œªx.x‚ä©Comp).
Finally, equality formation gives us ((Œªx.x)‚àà(A‚ÜíB)).
Both (A<:B) and this assume A itself, rather than (t‚ààA).
The standard wisdom is that typing judgments are not something you can assume.
In other words, that A equality is respected in B.
This should only be a consequence of subtyping, not a presupposition of it.
So these semantic judgments are true at the same time, but have different presuppositions.
This representation makes it explicit that subtyping implies respect for equality.
Here is a summary of important lessons we tried to convey:
In other words, the type presupposes itself.
It‚Äôs also not non-negatable in CompLF, which uses relaxed equality.
There is another semantic judgment which is still non-negatable: type validity.
It‚Äôs kind of a weird trick that this judgment is representable as a type.
So what‚Äôs the big trick?
Basically, to use almost any trivially true proposition that mentions the type.
We‚Äôll use: TpOK(A)‚âîA‚äÉ‚ä§
So it‚Äôs either true or nonsense; it‚Äôs non-negatable.
We have: ‚àÄp.(Atype)‚áî(p‚ä©TpOK(A))
This is precisely when A is a quotient of Comp.
In other words, such ordinary elimination rules help to conclude ordinary truth only.
Here are some consequences of combined elimination on represented judgments:
You can beta convert in a type validity judgment.
Same goes for rewriting with an identity.
You can branch on a boolean in a valid type.
This is shown by eliminating b with the motive (C[x]‚âîTpOK(xTF)).
So without the combined elimination, we‚Äôd be in an infinite regress.
That is, it‚Äôs only a type family over a pair of computations.
For example, you can prove derived rules showing that identity is symmetric and transitive.
Here is the defined judgment: A‚àãa‚âî(Atype)‚áí(a‚ä©A)
Here‚Äôs a more interesting direction change rule using subsumption: t‚ä©AA<:B‚àãpB‚àãt
That is, context entries are always synthesizing mode in our notation.
So it needs to compare them.
Most of the primitive type constructors have inversions for their formation rules.
(Type subexpressions are valid; element subexpressions have the appropriate type.)
Otherwise they would need to be proven again whenever applying an elimination rule.
The PER comprehension type constructor itself does not have any formation inversion rules.
But mostly it‚Äôs because the inversion rule wouldn‚Äôt really help.
For example, suppose we‚Äôre deriving Œ£ types.
But for validity, type-level implication is actually a conjunction.
Inversion rules for Œ£‚Ä≤ are not needed at all.
In general, there seems to be no use for inversion rules for PER comprehension.
It would not be dependent type theory if types depended only on types.
What kinds of requirements can be added to type validity?
And it turns out we can indeed do that.
It should validate the following rules: p‚ä©Pq‚ä©PreSup(P) PreSup(P)typep‚ä©‚åäP‚åã
It would be pretty straightforward to just add a primitive type constructor to do this.
And it‚Äôs really just a lucky break that we don‚Äôt have to.
(Since they all have the same computations, namely the booleans.)
So PreSup(P) is non-negatable, and satisfies the rules above.
This section sketches the connection between dependent type theory and partial logic.
(Supposedly, Frege structures were not originally formulated that way.)
The terms of the applicative language correspond to the terms of CompLF.
Additionally, both term languages present an untyped computation system.
This corresponds to the type validity judgment form.
With Frege structures, there‚Äôs a strong metatheorem about representability.
Kahle calls it ‚ÄúProposition 5‚Äù.
This allows representing any formula with only positive occurrences of T.
The disjunction available in CompLF is only a type when both disjuncts are.
Clearly not all tautologies do the trick.)
In Frege structures, too, proposition validity is non-negatable.
With the truth predicate, this can be expressed quite clearly as ¬¨T(¬¨Àô(x‚ÜíÀôx)).
It‚Äôs either ‚Äútrue‚Äù (combined true) or not a proposition.
But you can‚Äôt, since proposition validity is non-negatable.
This was prior to Peter Aczel‚Äôs paper that coined ‚ÄúFrege structures‚Äù.
Hopefully that was done by Aczel, but that paper is paywalled.
In the terminology of Frege structures, it‚Äôs not a proposition.
Formalizing this requires the logical framework, since type validity is non-negatable.)
Scott gives three-valued truth tables for the connectives.
Meanwhile Frege structures can define (the classical special cases of) CompLF‚Äôs connectives.
That is, short-circuiting conjunction and implication, and strict disjunction and quantifiers.
The predicates obtained in this way are usually non-negatable.
But this would not arise from a plain first-order definition.
Or you could think of them as proper classes.
But the properness is certainly not about cardinality.
These collect into a class, V, expressing that something is a propositional function.
He shows some good derived rules for Œ†.
This version resembles Kahle‚Äôs truth theory, and has a restricted T-schema.
Free logics seem to be essentially the same idea as logics of partial terms.
There is a SEP article about free logic.
Functions (elements of Œ† types) also have types as their domains.
Or is it (t‚ä©T)? Or (T‚àãt)?
Actually, maybe the positive approach was intended to rule out truth value gaps.
In that case it would not be more general than neutral.
(And none of these approaches would explain CompLF.)
So the neutral approach corresponds to inversion principles for atomic type constructors.
Atomic predicates are then interpreted simply as relations on the outer domain.
So the ‚Äúinterpretation‚Äù of terms is just a quotient projection.
Relations on the outer domain are used as the interpretations of judgment forms.
So in general, they correspond to predicates in the positive approach.
They can be made more negative using conjunction.
This is an original and tentative definition.
Should they be an arity class?
Let Œ∫ be a set of cardinal numbers.
If Œ∫={0,1}, then a Œ∫-arity space is precisely a coherence space.
This might follow from constructing it using double gluing and orthogonality.
We can define arity spaces by a variation on the double gluing construction.
1. Objects are relations ‚ä•‚äÜX√óY 2.
Autotopy is an isotopy from (A,‚ãÖ) to itself.
Being isotopic is a relation of equivalence.
Every loop isotopic to a group is isomorphic to a group.
This is why isotopy is a non-interesting notion for groups.
Mike: Shouldn‚Äôt we allow ‚Äúoriented bonds‚Äù as well?
This example also goes up in dimension, for instance modules over algebras over rings.
right, the module example currently does not really fit yet.
Do you see what I mean.
Maybe I am mixed up about this.
My point about cobordisms has to do with orientations.
I would like to develop this in the following here on this page.
If not, this should eventually be discarded.
First recall some basics of posets to fix our notation.
For C a category with colimits, MultiCoSpan(C) is a bond structure.
We have to check the sewing condition.
We write Hyperstructures:=MultiCoSpans(Set Posets¬Ø op) for the hyperstructure of hyperstructures.
The above general definition in particular reproduces the ordinary composition of cospans.
Let C be a category with colimits.
This is indeed the ordinary composite of the two cospans F and F‚Ä≤.
It seems to me that this definition doesn‚Äôt contain enough information.
(in particular, its universal property in C seems to have been forgotten).
This should say that any two fillers are themselves connected by a filler.
But I am not sure that I see what this has to do with intersections.
Shouldn‚Äôt we we be looking at inclusions?
Usually, if one works the the other does too.
Occasionally one fails where the other succeeds due to set-theoretic technicalities.
It definitely does not feel to me as though the smallest hyperstructure should exist.
The problem with your proposal is when you say ‚Äúform all composites.‚Äù
I need to think about a nice way to formalize such a cancellation.
Can someone please clarify the rules on this page?
Note that we can write kùí≥=‚ü®X,kŒº X‚ü© for k‚àà‚Ñï.

But without Choice, we can still consider this collection of cardinalities.
Then a first-countable space is simply one whose characters are all countable.
Properties second-countable: there is a countable base of the topology.
metrisable: the topology is induced by a metric.
separable: there is a countable dense subset.
Lindel√∂f: every open cover has a countable sub-cover.
metacompact: every open cover has a point-finite open refinement.
first-countable: every point has a countable neighborhood base
second-countable spaces are Lindel√∂f.
weakly Lindel√∂f spaces with countably locally finite base are second countable.
separable metacompact spaces are Lindel√∂f.
Lindel√∂f spaces are trivially also weakly Lindel√∂f.

In (Baez-Dolan 97) this has been called the microcosm principle.
This generalization includes internal categories and enriched categories.
These do not generally include all examples, but often include many of them.
See at (‚àû,1)-algebra over an (‚àû,1)-operad for examples and further details.
Discussion is in The Microcosm Principle
It was this property they owe their introduction to (J√≥nsson&Tarski 1956,1961).
A profunctorial variation on this theme has been proposed by Leinster (2007).
See at J√≥nsson-Tarski topos for some details.
An ordinary small category is a category internal to Set.
Let A be a category with pullbacks.
Functors between internal categories are defined in a similar fashion.
A category in A is precisely a monad in Span(A).
Finally the unit and associativity axioms for monads imply those above.
This approach makes it easy to define the notion of internal profunctor.
That description will carry across to give a nerve construction for an internal category.
Internal functors between internal categories induce simplicial morphisms between the corresponding nerves.
Discussion in homotopy type theory is at internal category in homotopy type theory.
A small category is a category internal to Set.
This generalises immediately to a smooth category?.
Similarly, a topological groupoid is a groupoid internal to Top.

A Baez-Crans 2-vector space is a category internal to Vect.
First suppose E is finitely complete.
Now suppose that E is finitely complete and cartesian closed.
The remainder of the proof is then finished by the following lemma.
For the precise statement see at 2-topos ‚Äì

I am a grad student at Berkeley, advised by Constantin Teleman.
I am mainly interested in algebraic geometry and mathematical physics.
One expects the Yoneda lemma to generalize to essentially every flavor of higher category theory.
But fundamental physics is governed by the gauge principle.
In mathematics this is called a homotopy.
Homotopy theory is gauged mathematics.
This way homotopy theory subsumes group theory.
This way homotopy theory subsumes parts of topological group theory.
The plain sets are recovered as the special case of 0-groupoids.
Hence homotopy types are equivalently ‚àû-groupoids.
However, without further tools this construction is unwieldy.
is due to (Joyal, def. E.1.2).
Let ùíû be any category.
By precomposition, this induces functors d i:ùíû Œî[2]‚ü∂ùíû Œî[1].
Let ùíû be a category and let K‚äÇMor(ùíû) be a class of morphisms.
Then: Both classes contain the class of isomorphism of ùíû.
Both classes are closed under composition in ùíû.
KProj is also closed under transfinite composition.
KProj is closed under forming coproducts in ùíû Œî[1].
KInj is closed under forming products in ùíû Œî[1].
We go through each item in turn.
Hence in particular there is a lift when p‚ààK and so i‚ààKProj.
The other case is formally dual.
Now the bottom commuting square has a lift, by assumption.
The case of composing two morphisms in KProj is formally dual.
Hence j has the left lifting property against all p‚ààK and hence is in KProj.
The other case is formally dual.
We need to construct a diagonal lift of that square.
The other case is formally dual.
By assumption, each of these has a lift ‚Ñì s.
The other case is formally dual.
We need to show that then also f‚ààW.
First consider the case that f‚ààFib.
In this case, factor w as a cofibration followed by an acyclic fibration.
This now exhibits f as a retract of an acyclic fibration.
These are closed under retract by prop. .
Now consider the general case.
Consider a composite morphism f:X‚ü∂iA‚ü∂pY.
We discuss the first statement, the second is formally dual.
This gets already close to producing the intended factorization:
For the present purpose we just need the following simple version:
Let ùíû be a model category, def. , and X‚ààùíû an object.
where X‚ÜíPath(X) is a weak equivalence and Path(X)‚ÜíX√óX is a fibration.
and X‚äîX‚ÜíCyl(X) is a cofibration.
Let ùíû be a model category.
We discuss the case of the path space object.
The other case is formally dual.
Let f,g:X‚ü∂Y be two parallel morphisms in a model category.
Let f,g:X‚ÜíY be two parallel morphisms in a model category.
Let X be cofibrant.
Let X be fibrant.
We discuss the first case, the second is formally dual.
Let Œ∑:Cyl(X)‚ü∂Y be the given left homotopy.
Now the composite Œ∑Àú‚âîh‚àòi 1 is a right homotopy as required:
The symmetry and reflexivity of the relation is obvious.
Let ùíû be a model category, def. .
For postcomposition we may choose to exhibit homotopy by left homotopy and argue dually.
Let ùíû be a model category.
Now to see that the image on morphisms is well defined.
Now let F:ùíû‚ü∂D be any functor that sends weak equivalences to isomorphisms.
Here now all horizontal morphisms are isomorphisms, by assumption on F.
ùíû f and ùíû c each inherit ‚Äúhalf‚Äù of the factorization axioms.
We discuss this for the former; the second is formally dual:
By corollary this is just as good for the purpose of homotopy theory.
Let ùíü be a category with weak equivalences.
The other case is formally dual.
Let f:X‚ü∂Y be a weak equivalence in ùíû f.
Therefore also F(p 0‚àòp 1 *f) is a weak equivalence.
Let ùíû,ùíü be model categories and consider F:ùíû‚ü∂ùíü a functor.
Let F:ùíû‚ü∂ùíü be a functor between two model categories (def. ).
We discuss the first case, the second is formally dual.
The conditions in def. are indeed all equivalent.
We discuss statement (i), statement (ii) is formally dual.
Consider the second case, the first is formally dual.
Hence L(X‚äîX‚Üí‚ààCofCyl(X))=(L(X)‚äîL(X)‚Üí‚ààCofL(Cyl(X))) is a cofibration.
This establishes the adjunction.
But this is the statement of Prop. .
To see that 4)‚áí3): Consider the weak equivalence LX‚ü∂j LXPLX.
In certain situations the conditions on a Quillen equivalence simplify.
But p R(c) is a weak equivalence by definition of cofibrant replacement.
Moreover, it should satisfy its universal property up to such homotopies.
Similarly a Killing vector is a covariantly constant vector field.
Pairing two covariant constant spinors to a vector yields a Killing vector.

Clearly hom(X√ó0,Y) is inhabited by X√ó0‚Üí0‚ÜíY for any object Y.

There is a forgetful 2-functor 2Comm‚ÜíComm.

A Hecke correspondence is a certain correspondence between a moduli stacks of bundles.
The integral transform induced by a Hecke correspondence is called a Hecke transform.
These are central objects of interest in geometric Langlands duality.
For modular curves The reference for this is section 1.4 of Calegari13.
We can think of the Hecke correspondence as the multivalued function œÄ 2*‚àòœÄ 1 *.
In this way it is more properly seen as a correspondence.
A reference for this is section 3.7 of Frenkel05.
A discussion can also be found in Lafforgue18.
Hence it is a kind of topological bundle of C *-algebras.
A pullback is therefore the categorical semantics of an equation.
In other words, the fiber product is the product taken fiber-wise.
It is, in fact, a simple special case of a limit.
It is well defined up to unique isomorphism.
The last commutative square above is called a pullback square.
Pullbacks preserve monomorphisms and isomorphisms:
Suppose the right-hand inner square is a pullback, then:
So one square is universal iff the other is.
On homotopy groups these are genera with coefficients in the underlying ring œÄ ‚Ä¢(E).
First recall the following two basic facts about the construction of Thom spaces.
See at Thom space this prop..
Under taking the colimit over k, this produces the claimed pullback.
Observe that the analog of prop. still holds:
The right adjoint is the ‚àû-group of units-(‚àû,1)-functor, see there for more details.
This is (ABGHR, theorem 2.1/3.2).
This plays the role of the classifying space for gl 1(R)-principal ‚àû-bundles.
Remark This means that a morphism Mf‚ÜíA is an GL 1(R)-equivariant map P‚ÜíA.
This is made precise by the following statement.
This is (ABGHR, theorem 2.10).
This is in (ABGHR, section 8).
This construction evidently extendes to an (‚àû,1)-functor Œì:‚àûGrpd /RLine‚ÜíRMod.
This observation appears as (Wilson 13, prop. 4.4).
The presentation of the following proof follows (Francis, lecture 3).
We first construct a map Œò:Œ© n un‚ÜíœÄ nMO.
This defines an element in the homotopy group œÄ n+k(Th(N ŒΩ)).
We check that this construction provides an inverse to Œò.
By the symmetric monoidal smash product of spectra this becomes a monoidal category.

This is an attempt at developing such a cohesive homotopy type theory.

Let H be a locally ‚àû-connected (‚àû,1)-topos H‚ÜíŒì‚ÜêLConst‚ÜíŒ†‚àûGrpd.

This follows from œÑ ‚â§nLConstŒ†(X)‚âÉLConstœÑ ‚â§nŒ†(X).
Take also the left bottom square to be a homotopy pullback.
Similarly, form now the top square as a pullback.

Regions thus become more differentiated, and the variance of the expansion rate grows.
In an inhomogeneous space, different regions expand at different rates.
Regions with faster expansion rate increase their volume more rapidly, by definition.
Acceleration is a transient phenomenon associated with the volume becoming dominated by the underdense region.
In this gauge backreaction becomes large and the gauge actually breaks down during structure formation.

Let F be a finite field.

In this way, ‚Ñï¬Ø is the Alexandroff compactification of the discrete space ‚Ñï.
Another common representation uses 1/(n+1) instead of 1/2 n.

Evidently an open subspace of a Riemann surface is a Riemann surface.
The transition map is 1z and thus holomorphic on U 1‚à©U 2=‚ÑÇ *.
An important example comes from analytic continuation, which we will briefly sketch below.
Then X is actually a Riemann surface.
Then the coordinate projections (g,W)‚Üíw 0 form appropriate local coordinates.
For instance, we can locally get a Laurent expansion, etc.
Sections of this bundle will be called (complex-valued) 1-forms.
Similarly, we do the same for 2-forms.
These form a basis for the complexified cotangent space at each point of U.
There is also a dual basis ‚àÇ‚àÇz:=12(‚àÇ‚àÇx‚àíi‚àÇ‚àÇy),‚àÇ‚àÇz¬Ø:=12(‚àÇ‚àÇx+i‚àÇ‚àÇy) for the complexified tangent space.
This is always possible locally, and a holomorphic map preserves the decomposition.
To see this, we have tacitly observed that dv=v zdz+v z¬Ødz¬Ø.

Idea The determinant is the (essentially unique) universal alternating multilinear map.
It is called the j th alternating power (of V).
Another point of view on the alternating power is via superalgebra.
There is a canonical natural isomorphism Œõ n(V‚äïW)‚âÖ‚àë j+k=nŒõ j(V)‚äóŒõ k(W).
Again take V to be the category of supervector spaces.
In particular, Œõ n(V) is 1-dimensional.
The number of such expressions is (nj).
It is manifestly functorial since Œõ n is, i.e., D(fg)=D(f)D(g).
The quantity D(f) is called the determinant of f. Determinant of a matrix
We work over fields of arbitrary characteristic.
The determinant satisfies the following properties, which taken together uniquely characterize the determinant.
If A t is the transpose of A, then det(A t)=det(A).

There are various ways of forming a category of simple graphs.
We will write E(x,y) to mean (x,y)‚ààE.
The resulting category of simple graphs is denoted by SimpGph.
of course that doesn‚Äôt preclude consideration of other types of graph.
The category SimpGph has very good properties.
For example, Theorem SimpGph is a Grothendieck quasitopos.
(See also Adamek and Herrlich.)
In other words, a simple graph in this language is exactly a separated presheaf.
It is easy to describe monos and epis in SimpGph.
For, let Œì=hom(1,‚àí):SimpGph‚ÜíSet be the underlying vertex-set forgetful functor.
We omit the easy proof.
It follows that Œì:SimpGph‚ÜíSet both preserves and reflects monos and epis.
As a result, we can prove various simple exactness results in SimpGph.
Since Œì reflects monos, this means k is monic in SimpGph.
As already observed, there is a chain of adjoint functors Œî‚ä£Œì‚ä£‚àá:Set‚ÜíSimpGph.

Small categories are free of some of the subtleties that apply to large categories.
Thus, a U-small category is a category internal to USet.
This of course is a material formulation.
Such structural U-smallness may be substituted in the discussion below.
Let USet be the category of U-small sets.
The notion of normal subgroups generalizes from groups to ‚àû-groups.
The following definition takes this as the defining property of ‚Äúnormality‚Äù of morphisms.
Here the object on the right is any 0-connected ‚àû-groupoid.
Such a normal morphism equivalently exhibits an ‚àû-group extension G of G‚´ΩK by K.

The proof is entirely straightforward and will be omitted.
Then the homotopy fiber of its delooping is the action groupoid G‚´ΩK=(G√óK‚Üíp 1‚Üí(‚àí)‚ãÖf(‚àí)G).

Therefore in this case the localization modality deserves to be called the affine modality.
Let now A be a simplicial abelian group.
In this abelian cases are two other chain complexes naturally associated with A:
All elements of A 0 are regarded a non-degenerate.
Elements of D(A) n are often called thin n-simplices.
For j=n‚àí1 this is then the desired result.
Write œÄ n(G)n‚àà‚Ñï for the n-th simplicial homotopy group of G.
The first isomorphism follows with the Eckmann-Hilton argument.
So the above statement says that the Moore complex functor N respects these weak equivalences.
All this is discussed at Dold-Kan correspondence.
The Moore complex of a simplicial group is naturally a hypercrossed complex.
This has been established in (Carrasco-Cegarra).
Typically one has pairings NG p√óNG q‚ÜíNG p+q.
These use the Conduch√© decomposition theorem, see the discussion at hypercrossed complex.
These Moore complexes are easily understood in low dimensions:
Hence even after normalization the singular simplicial chain complex is ‚Äúhuge‚Äù.
Nevertheless it is quasi-isomorphic to the tiny chain complex found above.
There is also a never published John C. Moore, Algebraic homotopy theory.

This type of construction is called Epstein-Glaser renormalization.
This is called (‚Äúre‚Äù-)normalization by UV-Regularization via Counterterms.
This still leaves open the question how to choose the counterterms.
This yields the St√ºckelberg-Petermann renormalization group.
This conclusion is theorem below.
Following this, statement and detailed proof appeared in (Brunetti-Fredenhagen 00).
Then we show that these unique products on these special subsets do coincide on intersections.
This yields the claim by a partition of unity.

Its scaling degree is sd(Œî F) =n‚àí2 =p‚àí1.
Let X‚äÇŒπX^ be an inclusion of open subsets of some Cartesian space.
This induces the operation of restriction of distributions ùíü‚Ä≤(X^)‚ü∂Œπ *ùíü‚Ä≤(X).
This is shown in (Brunetti-Fredenhagen 00, p. 24).
This is essentially (H√∂rmander 90, thm. 3.2.4).
Now let œÅ‚âîdeg(u).
Therefore to conclude it is now sufficient to show that deg(u‚àòp œÅ^)=œÅ.
This is shown in (Brunetti-Fredenhagen 00, p. 25).
By prop. this always exists.
This proves the first statement.
This directly implies the claim.
The condition ‚Äúperturbation‚Äù is immediate from the corresponding condition on ùíÆ and ùíÆ‚Ä≤.
It only remains to see that Z k indeed takes values in local observables.
This group is called the St√ºckelberg-Petermann renormalization group.
We will construct that ùíµ Œõ in terms of these projections p œÅ.
First consider some convenient shorthand: For n‚àà‚Ñï, write ùíµ ‚â§n‚âî‚àë1‚àà{1,‚ãØ,n}1n!Z n.
We proceed by induction over n‚àà‚Ñï.
This means that Z n+1,Œõ is supported on the diagonal, and is hence local.
Inserting this for the first summand in (17) shows that limŒõ‚Üí‚àûK n+1,Œõ=0.
That this is the case is the statement of this prop..
This is similar to a group of UV-cutoff scale-transformations.
This is often called the Wilsonian RG.
This goes back to (Polchinski 84, (27)).
In this case the choice of ("re"-)normalization hence ‚Äúflows with scale‚Äù.
it is sufficient to check causal factorization.
This implies the equation itself.
Let C be a finitely complete category, and let T be an endofunctor on C.
In particular, this implies that T preserves monos.
Let Œ∏:X‚ÜíTX be a T-coalgebra structure on X.
Hence (X,Œ∏) is well-founded.
Then, inside Y consider the system of well-founded subcoalgebras of Œæ.
The colimit of this system, assuming it exists, will be the initial algebra.
The connection with initial algebras goes a little further.
Hence initial algebras are semi-Peano, and Peano by Lambek‚Äôs theorem.
See well-founded relation for more information.
The same idiom applies more generally to well-founded coalgebras.

This page is about topology as a field of mathematics.
For topology as a structure on a set, see topological space.
Topology as a structure enables one to model continuity and convergence locally.
A detailed introduction is going to be at Introduction to Topology.
First assume that f is continuous in the epsilontic sense.
Conversely, assume that f ‚àí1 takes open subsets to open subsets.
Therefore we should pay attention to open subsets.
The union of any set of open subsets is again an open subset.
A topological space is a set X equipped with such a topology.
Pre-Images of open subsets are open.
The composition of continuous functions is clearly associative and unital.
This is called the metric topology.
(Also called the initial topology of the inclusion map.)
(This is also called the final topology of the projection œÄ.)

Consider then the function f:[0,1]‚ü∂S 1 given by t‚Ü¶(cos(2œÄt),sin(2œÄt)).
We claim that fÀú is a homeomorphism (definition ).
First of all it is immediate that fÀú is a continuous function.
So we need to check that fÀú has a continuous inverse function.

We introduce the simplest and indicate their use.
Assume there were a homeomorphism f:‚Ñù 1‚ü∂‚Ñù 2 we will derive a contradiction.
Use topological invariants to distinguish topological spaces.
Of course in practice one uses more sophisticated invariants than just œÄ 0.
Let X be a topological space and let x‚ààX be a chosen point.
Under concatenation of loops, œÄ 1(X,x) becomes a semi-group.
This is called the fundamental group of X at x.
As œÄ 0, so also œÄ 1 is a topological invariant.
But they do have different fundamental groups œÄ 1:
We discuss this further below in example .
The above construction yields a functor Cov(X)‚ü∂œÄ 1(X,x)Set.
Their corresponding permutation actions may be seen from the pictures on the right.
We are now ready to state the main theorem about the fundamental group.
This condition is satisfied for all ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù topological spaces:
This has some interesting implications:

This entry here is about the definition of cobordism categories for Riemannian cobordisms.
In physics terms such a functor is a Euclidean quantum field theory .
This requires refining the bordism category to a smooth category.
This realization will be described here.
Notice that this builds in an asymmetry: the (+)-side is preferred.
The composition of these cobordisms is given by I t‚àòI t‚Ä≤=I t+t‚Ä≤
This encodes the orientation reversal at that end.
This is defined for t>0.

Explicitly, a double profunctor H:C‚á∏D consists of the following.
As with any notion of profunctor, the appropriate hom should be a double profunctor.
There is a corresponding statement in the pseudo case (see below).

The concept is originally due to Felix Berezin.
A quantale is a closed monoidal suplattice.
(On affineness: see also semicartesian monoidal category.)
The name ‚Äúquantale‚Äù was introduced by C.J. Mulvey.)
If a‚â§x and a‚â§y, then a=a‚äóa‚â§x‚äóy.
This shows that Idem is the right adjoint as claimed.
There is a natural bijective correspondence between congruences on a quantale Q and nuclei on Q.
In particular, one can then study enriched categories over a quantale.
Quantales are a surprisingly commonplace structure in computer science.
Residuation in this case is ideal division (ùîû:ùîü)={x|xùîü‚äÜùîû}.
(The operator is assumed to be covariant with respect to the poset structure.)
(see e.g. Yetter 90, page 43).
A stronger notion is of strong morphisms of quantales seen as monoidal categories.
This often occurs in practice.
(An example is to be developed for buildings.)
An ‚Ñ≥-category is a category with two classes of morphisms: tight and loose.
Every ‚Ä†-category is an ‚Ñ≥-category in which the tight morphisms are the unitary isomorphisms.
In particular, Hilbert spaces form an ‚Ñ≥-category with unitary operators as tight morphisms.
Any strict category is an ‚Ñ≥-category with equalities as the tight morphisms.
(Thus the wide subcategory of tight morphisms is skeletal.)
Again the tight isomorphisms are simply the equalities.
Similarly, quotient objects form an ‚Ñ≥-category.
Let T be a strict 2-monad on a strict 2-category.

I hope it is appropriate to post this here.
Remarks Co-Heyting algebras were initially called Brouwerian algebras .
In constructive mathematics, however, they are irreducibly different.
In classical mathematics, there are even more options.
Now comparison can be dropped, as it follows from transitivity and connectedness.
Thus the most common definition uses only trichotomy and transitivity.
(The first item, however, is an exception.)
The big example in analysis is the field of real numbers.
However, the result will not necessarily be a total order or a linear order.

The following definitions are taken from Hofstra.
A homomorphism of PCA‚Äôs is a homomorphism of the underlying partial applicative structures.
Indeed, they need not be uniquely determined within the PCA.
The definition of PCA given above is traditional but somewhat opaque at first glance.
Hofstra defines a PCA to be a functionally complete partial applicative structure.
Let us check that skk indeed represents the identity function I.
Consider the second projection function, corresponding to x 1‚ààMagma(A+{x 0,x 1}).
In other words, we calculate kIab=((kI)a)b=Ib=b.
Following the proof of functional completeness, we have Œªx.xx=s(Œªx.x)(Œªx.x)=sII
In other words, models of the untyped lambda calculus give PCA‚Äôs.
A preliminary technical task is to encode pairing and unpairing functions by elements of A.
In other words, the preorder P(A) X is a Heyting prealgebra.
Take f,g:X‚ÜíP(A).
Then v=Œªb.p(tb)(ub) realizes h‚â§f‚àßg.
Thus f‚àßg is a product in the preorder.
Furthermore, suppose t realizes f‚â§h and u realizes g‚â§h.
Then v=Œªb.l(b)(p(t(rb))(u(rb))) realizes f‚à®g‚â§h.
Let R be a commutative ring.
We write also A‚äó RB for the tensor product of algebras.

Talking with Bill, I often feel like a fly buzzing around a cow.
On any easy question, I‚Äôll probably see the answer first.
Later he introduced the notion of cohesive topos as a more general foundation of geometry.
I liked experimental physics but did not appreciate the imprecise reasoning in some theoretical courses.
So I decided to study mathematics first.
Truesdell was at the Mathematics Department but he had a great knowledge in Engineering Physics.
He took charge of my education there.
Categories would clearly be important for simplifying the foundations of continuum physics.
I concluded that I would make category theory a central line of my study.

How did you arrive at the program of Categorical Dynamics and Synthetic Differential Geometry?
From January 1967 to August 1967 I was Assistant Professor at the University of Chicago.
My own motivation came from my earlier study of physics.
And might this not lead to a simpler, equally rigorous account?

This entry is about the phenomenon of universality in physics.
Sets of systems which are equivalent in this manner are known as universality classes.
People have identified universality classes, with varying degrees of rigour.
The universality classes we understand best correspond to fixed points of renormalization-group transforms.
This gives rise to what might be termed the ‚Äòconformal periodic table‚Äô.
The first few examples may be identified with well-known universality classes.
Some relationships between columns can be identified.
See (Takeuchi et al.).
The modern terminology of this subject dates to the late 1960s and early ‚Äô70s.

Any geometric morphism between localic topoi is localic.
Any geometric embedding is localic.
Any √©tale geometric morphism is localic.
This is supported by the following fact.
The last bit is lemma 1.2 in (Johnstone).
The corresponding left class is the class of hyperconnected geometric morphisms.
This is the main statement in (Johnstone).
The discussion there is based on
Write BG for its delooping.
Equivalently, this is the action groupoid INN(G)=G//G‚âïEG of G acting on itself.
This makes it evident that INN(G) is contractible BINN(G)‚Üí‚âÉ*.
To emphasize this we also write EG‚âîINN(G).
We have a natural sequence of groupoids G‚ÜíEG‚ÜíBG.
This fact is useful in various applications in nonabelian cohomology.
More generally, see at infinitesimal disk bundle.
We say that C is the homotopy cofiber of f.
Specifically for cofiber sequences of topological spaces see at topological cofiber sequence.

Of course every abelian category is pre-abelian.
However, it is not abelian; the monomorphism 2:‚Ñ§‚Üí‚Ñ§ is not a kernel.
If ‚ãÑ is monadic?, then p is stable iff p‚â°‚ãÑq for some q.
In intuitionistic logic, the default is the double negation modality ¬¨¬¨.

(This is because p is decidable iff p‚à®¬¨p is stable.)
The cochain cohomology of the BRST complex is called, of course, BRST cohomology.
The BRST complex described a homotopical quotient of a space by an infinitesimal action.
Combined with a homotopical intersection, it is part of the BRST-BV complex.

One way to make this precise is by the process of simplicial localization .
A single (‚àû,1)-category can admit many different such presentations.
See the section Presentations of (‚àû,1)-categories below for more details.
In a relative category the condition is slightly weaker.
Relative categories have a good homotopy theory.
In a category of fibrant objects there are additional auxiliary morphisms called fibrations.
In a Waldhausen category there are additional auxiliary morphisms called cofibrations.
Other variants include Cartan-Eilenberg category, ‚Ä¶ Additional conditions
In fact, these three conditions are closely related.
In any model category, all three conditions hold automatically.
This is discussed at model structure on categories with weak equivalences.
Equivalently this is the homotopy category of an (‚àû,1)-category of C.

A spatial locale is a locale that comes from a topological space.
This is an extra property of locales, a property of having enough points.
Let X be a topological space.
L has enough points, as defined above.
The corresponding condition on topological spaces is being sober.
However, it is still a bit long.
Occasionally one sees ‚Äòspacial‚Äô instead of ‚Äòspatial‚Äô.
Assuming the axiom of choice, locally compact locales are spatial.
In particular, compact regular locales are locally compact, hence automatically spatial.
Any coherent locale is also spatial.
The completion of a uniform locale with a countable basis of uniformity is spatial.
Stonean locales are spatial.

Cocomplete possibly-large categories generated under filtered colimits by small generators under small relations.
An adjoint 2-tuple is just an ordinary adjunction.
An adjoint 3-tuple is an adjoint triple.

An actual algebraic theory is one where all operations are total functions.
This gives a generalisation of Lawvere theories, which describe finitary algebraic theories.
As alluded to above, the most concise and elegant definition is through category theory.
We do this in what follows.
These are equivalent to categories of models of finite limit sketches.
As mentioned above, categories are models of a finitary essentially algebraic theory.
See this paper by Barr for a proof.
Essentially algebraic theories are equivalent to partial Horn theories (Palmgren, Vickers).
Freyd first introduced essentially algebraic theories here:
A standard source is Johnstone (2002).
There are several formalisms approaching such a derived functor.
This is especially common when talking about profinite groups and related topics.

The analytic completion is instead the quotient A[[x]]/(x‚àíp)A[[x]].
In general though they are different.
Of course, F is in this poset.
Although this proof uses Zorn‚Äôs lemma, the statement itself is weaker.
It therefore cannot prove the axiom of dependent choice either.
It can prove some traditional applications of dependent choice.
For example, it can be used to linearly order any set.
Any topos with an internal ultrafilter principle is thus a De Morgan topos.

For a derivation see the examples at homotopy colimit.
Proposition (diagonal is homotopy colimit)
This appears for instance as theorem 3.6 in (Isaacson).
This induces an adjoint triple ssSet‚ü∂+ *‚üµ+ *‚ü∂+ !sSet.
These statements are for instance in (CegarraRemedios) and (Stevenson).
Remark After geometric realization these spaces are even related by a homeomorphism.
See geometric realization of simplicial topological spaces.
There are various useful model category structures on the category of bisimplicial sets.
Induced from the diagonal There is an adjunction (L‚ä£diag):ssSet‚ü∂diag‚üµLsSet.
This is due to (Moerdijk 89) Induced from codiagonal T.
The transferred model structure on ssSet along the total simplicial set functor T exists.
And for it (Dec‚ä£T):ssSet‚ü∂T‚üµDecsSet is a Quillen equivalence.
This is (CegarraRemedios, theorem 9).
Because of this, some care is needed when using these sources.

hence it is interested only in the ‚Äúweak homotopy types‚Äù of topological spaces.
For classical homotopy theory this is accordingly called the classical model structure on topological spaces.
Its isomorphisms are the homeomorphisms.
Generally, recall: Definition
We now discuss limits and colimits in ùíû= Top.
The key for understanding these is the fact that there are initial and final topologies:
let S‚ààSet be a bare set
But this is precisely what the initial topology ensures.
The case of the colimit is formally dual.
Notice that S ‚àí1=‚àÖ and that S 0=*‚äî*.
A top element ‚ä§ is one for which a‚â§‚ä§.
An ordinal is the equivalence class of a well-order.
A limit ordinal is one that is not a successor.
Here (n+1) is the successor of n.
The first non-empty limit ordinal is œâ=[(‚Ñï,‚â§)].
We now turn to the discussion of mapping spaces/exponential objects.
Accordingly this is called the compact-open topology on the set of functions.
The construction extends to a functor (‚àí) (‚àí):Top lc op√óTop‚ü∂Top.
it is often assumed that Y is also a Hausdorff topological space.
But this is not necessary.
Proposition fails in general if Y is not locally compact.
Therefore the plain category Top of all topological spaces is not a Cartesian closed category.
For instance on general pointed topological spaces the smash product is in general not associative.
This we turn to below.
The fundamental concept of homotopy theory is clearly that of homotopy.
This is simply a continuous path in X whose endpoints are x and y.
By composition this extends to a functor œÄ 0:Top‚ü∂Set.
But this is important, for instance in the proof of the Brown representability theorem.
See the section Brown representability theorem in Part S.
Every homotopy equivalence, def. , is a weak homotopy equivalence, def. .
In particular a deformation retraction, def. , is a weak homotopy equivalence.
This we turn to now.
This is the formal dual to example .
We consider topological spaces that are built consecutively by attaching basic cells.
A topological space X is a cell complex if ‚àÖ‚ü∂X is a relative cell complex.
So let Y be a topological cell complex and C‚Ü™Y a compact subspace.
It is now sufficient to show that P has no accumulation point.
To that end, let c‚ààC be any point.
If c is a 0-cell in Y, write U c‚âî{c}.
Let Œ≥ be the ordinal of the full cell complex.
Hence it is now sufficient to show that Œ≤ max=Œ≥.
We argue this by showing that assuming Œ≤ max<Œ≥ leads to a contradiction.
So assume Œ≤ max<Œ≥.
Hence via attaching along D n+1‚ÜíD n+1√óI the cylinder over œÉ is erected.
here the top pushout is the one from example .
Hence it is now sufficient to show that this is also a homotopy right inverse.
Hence the composite œÄ n(X)‚ü∂‚âÉœÄ n(X^) is an isomorphism.
These are called Hurewicz fibrations.
But for simple special cases this is readily seen directly, too.
Other deformations of the n-disks are useful in computations, too.
Assume that [Œ±] is in the kernel of f *.
Hence œÄ n(X^)‚ÜíœÄ n(X) has trivial kernel and so is injective.
B) I Top-injective morphisms are in particular Serre fibrations
Let f:X‚ÜíY be a Serre fibration that induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups.
However, without further auxiliary structure, these simplicial localizations are in general intractable.
is due to (Joyal, def. E.1.2).
We now dicuss the concept of weak factorization systems appearing in def. .
Let ùíû be any category.
By precomposition, this induces functors d i:ùíû Œî[2]‚ü∂ùíû Œî[1].
Let ùíû be a category and let K‚äÇMor(ùíû) be a class of morphisms.
Both classes contain the class of isomorphisms of ùíû.
Both classes are closed under composition in ùíû.
KProj is also closed under transfinite composition.
KProj is closed under forming coproducts in ùíû Œî[1].
KInj is closed under forming products in ùíû Œî[1].
We go through each item in turn.
Hence in particular there is a lift when p‚ààK and so i‚ààKProj.
The other case is formally dual.
Now the bottom commuting square has a lift, by assumption.
The case of composing two morphisms in KProj is formally dual.
Hence j has the left lifting property against all p‚ààK and hence is in KProj.
The other case is formally dual.
We need to construct a diagonal lift of that square.
The other case is formally dual.
By assumption, each of these has a lift ‚Ñì s.
The other case is formally dual.
We need to show that then also f‚ààW.
First consider the case that f‚ààFib.
This now exhibits f as a retract of an acyclic fibration.
These are closed under retract by prop. .
Now consider the general case.
Consider a composite morphism f:X‚ü∂iA‚ü∂pY.
We discuss the first statement, the second is formally dual.
This gets already close to producing the intended factorization:
For the present purpose we just need the following simple version: Definition
Let ùíû be a model category, def. , and X‚ààùíû an object.
X‚ÜíPath(X) is a weak equivalence and Path(X)‚ÜíX√óX is a fibration.
and X‚äîX‚ÜíCyl(X) is a cofibration.
Let ùíû be a model category.
We discuss the case of the path space object.
The other case is formally dual.
Let f,g:X‚ü∂Y be two parallel morphisms in a model category.
Let f,g:X‚ÜíY be two parallel morphisms in a model category.
Let X be cofibrant.
Let Y be fibrant.
We discuss the first case, the second is formally dual.
Let Œ∑:Cyl(X)‚ü∂Y be the given left homotopy.
The symmetry and reflexivity of the relation is obvious.
Let ùíû be a model category, def. .
For postcomposition we may choose to exhibit homotopy by left homotopy and argue dually.
Let ùíû be a model category.
The construction in def. is indeed well defined.
Now to see that the image on morphisms is well defined.
Moreover, it is a weak homotopy equivalence.
See the proof of the general statement at finite topological space - properties.
This is what is known as strong conceptual completeness.
(Maybe I‚Äôll add some explicit computations later.)
A cartesian monoidal category which is also closed is called a cartesian closed category.
A strong monoidal functor between cartesian categories is called a cartesian functor.
These maps make any object into a comonoid.
If so, it is a theorem that C is a cartesian monoidal category.
As outlined above, cartesianity is an algebraic structure on top of a monoidal structure.
Traditionally this has been conceived in terms of model category presentations.
This we discuss in the section Model category presentation.
At the infinitesimal level automorphisms correspond to the derivations.
Its correct derived replacement is the cotangent complex of Grothendieck-Illusie.
The cotangent complex functor is effectively the left derived functor of the K√§hler differentials assignment.
This is the K√§hler differentials functor.
All said is true for simplicial commutative rings as well.
The Andr√©-Quillen cohomology of R is the cohomology of ùïÉŒ©(R).
Let P ‚Ä¢R be the corresponding bar construction simplicial algebra.
In particular, when C=..., then the cotangent complex assigns ‚Ä¶ .
See cotangent complex in derived geometry
For more background see deformation theory.
Apart from simplicial rings we can consider E ‚àû-rings.
See also deformation theory and references therein.
Thus it might reasonably be called simply a ‚ÑÇ-linear ‚Ä†-category.
In a *-category, the dagger operation ‚Ä† is synonymously denoted *.
The negation of every stable equivalence relation is an apartness relation.
There is thus a potential conflict between these rewritten forms of the word.
It is usual to choose a ‚Äònormal form‚Äô for each word.
These might be our choice of normal forms for the elements.
Tracelets are the intrinsic carriers of causal information in categorical rewriting systems.

This gives them a central place in harmonic analysis.
A tempered distribution is a continuous linear functional on this Schwartz space.
(compactly supported smooth funtions? are functions with rapidly decreasing partial derivatives)
It is an additive invariant in the sense of noncommutative motives.
This should coincide with the Waldhausen K-theory (presumably).

Then the slice topos ‚Ñ∞/A is De Morgan as well.
This result due to Peter Johnstone appears e.g. in Johnstone (1979).
For a proof see Caramello (2009).

Suppose that ùíü is finitely complete.
See Section 3 of (NRS18).
The following result is a consequence.
This is a basic instance of the general principle of Galois theory.
Direct unwinding of the definitions shows that this is indeed the case.
But this is the case by definition of Rec.
It remains to see that œµ E is itself natural in E.
This establishes an equivalence as required.
In fact this is an adjoint equivalence.

Consider schemes as covariant presheaves on CRing.
As such, they are examples of nice categories of spaces.
A primary example is the category of compactly generated spaces.
Frequently it is also felt desirable to add closure under certain types of subspaces.
This is in particular the case for compactly generated spaces.
See also Gaucher 2007, Sec. 2.
Further developments along these lines are inEscardo, Lawson &Simpson 2004:
Spaces which are Top-colimits of spaces in ùíû are called ùíû-generated.
If the unit interval I is ùíû-generated, then so are all CW-complexes.
The category of exponentiable spaces is not cartesian closed.
Suppose that an exponential ‚Ñù ‚Ñï exists in the category of locally compact Hausdorff spaces.

It is well-known that Top is not cartesian closed.
This typically involves the subtle and delicate interplay between compactness conditions and openness conditions.
For instance, it is monadic over Set (!) and a pretopos.
None of these is convenient in the precise sense above.
The requirements for convenience were spelled out in Brown 1964.

In fact, only the last step is generally valid in a wheel.
Wheels are like rigs in that there is generally no notion of subtraction.
It is common to write /0 as ‚àû and 0‚àû as ‚ä•.
The original example is the wheel of real numbers, denoted ‚Ñù ‚äô.
Reciprocals are immediate: /(a:b)‚âîb:a.
The identities 0 and 1 in ‚Ñù ‚äô are 0:1 and 1:1 respectively.
More generally, any real number a gives us an element a:1 of ‚Ñù ‚äô.
Now we're justified in writing a/b for a:b.
Fortunately, x+0=x and 1x=x remain true always.
One generalization of convexity to Riemannian manifolds and metric spaces is geodesic convexity.
The convex hull of a subset is the smallest convex subset containing it.
It is immediate from the definition that accessible functors are closed under composition.
Œª is sharply smaller than Œ∫, i.e. Œª‚ä≤Œ∫.
Indeed, this can be achieved simultaneously for any set of accessible functors.

The torsion-freeness condition says that F e=0.
This has been the historical route and is still widely used in the literature.
In other words, we just need to compute ‚àá ‚àÇ i‚àÇ j.
So let S ij:=‚àá ‚àÇ i‚àÇ j=‚àá ‚àÇ j‚àÇ i, by symmetry.
Let T ijk:=‚àÇ ig(‚àÇ j,‚àÇ k); these are smooth real functions.
We shall now prove existence in this restricted case.
We must check for compatibility.
We have already shown the uniqueness assertion, since that is local.
Connections restrict to connections on open subsets.
We get connections ‚àá i on U i compatible with g| U i.
We claim that ‚àá i| U i‚à©U j=‚àá j| U i‚à©U j.
This is an easy corollary of uniquness.

But the universal principal bundle is contractible EU(1)‚ü∂‚ààW cl*.
(Alternatively this is the special case of lemma for n=1.)
the restriction is even equal to 1‚ààœÄ 0(E).
Notice that this is a CW-spectrum (def., lemma).
Assume then by induction that maps f 2k have been found for k‚â§n.
Hence componentwise all these triangles commute up to some homotopy.
Now we invoke the Milnor sequence for generalized cohomology of spectra (prop.).
Hence again we have componentwise homotopies.
Let E be a homotopy commutative ring spectrum (def.).

This is a fibrant replacement or resolution of the original object.
The dual concept is called cofibrant replacement.
If the factorization is functorial, then it yields a fibrant replacement functor.
One can also take sums with coefficients in a partition of unity.

B) I started a systematic study of C-infinity rings as such.
Of course, they were already there, but nothing had been done with them.
This, I think, is the most important concept in the subject.

It is just the right concept needed.

See also motivation for sheaves, cohomology and higher stacks.
There are several equivalent ways to characterize sheaves.
Finally we give special discussion applicable in various common special cases.
In this form the definition appears for instance in (Johnstone, def. C2.1.2).-
We now reformulate the above component-wise definition in general abstract terms.
Write j:C‚Ü™PSh(C) for the Yoneda embedding.
This is also called the descent condition for descent along the covering family.
A morphism of sheaves is just a morphism of the underlying presheaves.
(The following was mentioned in Peter LeFanu Lumsdaine‚Äôs comment here).
This is true in full generality for the following case
the two respective diagrams become isomorphic, since Y√ó XU i‚ÜíU i is in W.
The monomorphisms in PSh(S) which are in W are called dense monomorphisms.
Urs: the above shows this almost.
So we finally conclude: Corollaries
But for sheafification one really needs the local isomorphisms, i.e. the hypercovers.
In general A + is not yet a sheaf.
The original definition is in Jean Leray, L‚Äôanneau d‚Äôhomologie d‚Äôune repr√©sentation.
This is an instance of change of enriching category.
Typically it is also assumed that G is Hausdorff.
(Notice that if not, then G/{1}¬Ø is Hausdorff.).
One often says just ‚Äúlocally compact group‚Äù.
In harmonic analysis We take here locally compact groups G to be also Hausdorff.
A similar argument is used for the right uniformity.

This entry relies on notation defined in generalized graph.
Wheeled graphs can have a number of attributes.
One of these, confusingly, is being wheel-free.
Using these definitions we can define the following sets:
Define Gr c ‚Ü∫ to be the set of connected wheeled graphs.
Define Gr c ‚Üë to be the set of connected wheel-free graphs.
Any quiver can be realized as a wheeled graph in an obvious way.
This is the c-colored exceptional edge.
It can be represented schematically by‚Üë c.
This is the c-colored exceptional loop.
The involution Œπ can be thought of as ‚Äúspinning‚Äù the loop.
It can be represented schematically by‚Ü∫ c.
The precise formulation is below in Definition ‚Äì For simplicial objects.
It is useful to decompose this statement into its constituents as follows:
This is made precise below in Definition ‚Äì For cellular objects.
Definition For simplicial objects Let ùíû be a category with pullbacks.
The archetypical role of the Segal condition is to make the following statement true.
This is due to Grothendieck 61, recalled in Segal 1968.
Not to be confused with the discussion here.

First we state some preliminaries.
Morphisms in Œî 0 have to send elementary edges to elementary edges.
We may call i *(X) the nerve of the graph X.
Then this is a coverage on Œî 0.
First of all the nerve has a left adjoint œÑ:PSh(Œî)‚ÜíCat.

(2) the integrals over X and g‚àòY are equal.
Theorem E[X|ùîñ] exists and is unique almost surely.
Let P| ùîñ be the restriction of P to ùîñ.
The theorem implies that Q has a density w.r.t P| ùîñ which is E[X|ùîñ].
From elementary probability theory we know that P(A)=E[1 A].
For A‚ààùîñ we call P(A|ùîñ):=E[1 A|ùîñ] the conditional probability of A provided B.
If Œº is a probability measure, then so is Q¬Ø(Œº).
The stochastic kernel is hence in particular an integral kernel.

We discuss first the definition of principal bundles
In the category of topological spaces This is historically and traditionally the default setup.
So the group G here is a topological group.
This is the original and oldest branch of the theory.
We start with the modern default notion and then look into its variants.
Let G be a topological group.
A standard modern textbook following this tradition is (Husem√∂ller).
More along these lines is at geometry of physics ‚Äì principal bundles.
In fact, this way every action becomes principal over its homotopy quotient.
This is discussed at principal ‚àû-bundle.
Under the Yoneda embedding this represents a prestack.
Write BG¬Ø for the corresponding stack obtained by stackification.
This is our GBund(‚àí) GBund(‚àí)=BG¬Ø(‚àí).
For instance for topological bundles this would be Top.
In higher category theory the notion of principal bundle has various vertical categorifications.
See for instance (Androulidakis).
We consider actions by topological groups and Lie groups.
This is originally due to (Gleason 50).
See e.g. (Cohen, theorem 1.3)
This is (Palais, theorem 4.1).
This is a direct corollary of prop. .
Originally this statement is due to (Samelson 41).
This is a corollary of theorem (Palais 61).
This cannot have local section because P is locally connected and G is not.
Therefore P is not even locally homeomorphic to (P/G)√óG. Gauge theory
In physics, principal bundles with connection and their higher categorical analogs model gauge fields.
See at fiber bundles in physics.
See also the references at classifying space.
Explicit examples and counter examples of coset principal bundles are discussed in
Extensions of principal bundles are discussed for instance in
Remark If D is a full subcategory then the second condition is automatic.
The following theorem is known as the comparison lemma.
This appears as (Johnstone, theorem C2.2.3).
But the restriction Set C op‚ÜíSet D op is not generally an equivalence.
See the dicussion here.
Then bOp(X) is a dense sub-site.
Replacing sheaves by (‚àû,1)-sheaves of spaces produces a strictly stronger notion.
See (‚àû,1)-comparison lemma for a sufficient criterion for a dense inclusion of (‚àû,1)-sites.
These are really models/presentations for stable (‚àû,1)-categories.
In fact, every linear A ‚àû-category is A ‚àû-equivalent to a dg-category.

(Such quantification is sometimes called ‚Äúunbounded‚Äù quantification.)
Namely, the generalized element u:X‚ÜíU names the pullback of UÀú‚ÜíU along u.
Another way is, of course, to move outside of C.
The object U in this case is, of course, the subobject classifier.
The definition is reproduced for instance in section 1.2 of
The category of sind-objects of ùíû is written sind-ùíû or SInd(ùíû).
It is the sifted colimit completion of ùíû.
This exhibits Sind(ùíû) as the free sifted colimit completion of ùíû.
ùíû is a distributive category.
Sind(ùíû) is cartesian closed.
Of course extensions need not be central or even abelian.
An important class of non-abelian extensions are semidirect product Lie algebras.
The rule g‚Ü¶œï(g) defines a homomorphism of Lie algebras œï:ùî§‚ÜíDer(ùî®).
Thus we obtain a well-defined map œï *:ùî§/ùî®‚ÜíDer(ùî®)/Int(ùî®).
The elements b‚ààùîü and k‚ààùî® in this decomposition are unique.
Thus we obtain a bijection ùî§‚Üíùîü√óùî®, g‚Ü¶([g],‚àíœÉ([g])+g).
The commutation rule has to be figured out.

This judgment is often written as ‚ÄúPtrue‚Äù.
Neither of these judgements is the same thing as the proposition P itself.

So we can use these universal properties as definitions of the constructions!
These are known as universal constructions.
Of course, these definitions are not actually ‚Äúconstructions‚Äù.
We first look at a few concrete examples of universal properties.
These are all special cases of the ones described below.
In this case, we tend to write A√óB for C.
Each of these may be defined by requiring it to satisfy a universal property.
In that case the cofinality is equivalent to the inclusion functor being a cofinal functor.
Nonempty subsets of a finite total order are cofinal iff they have the same maximum.
Every infinite subset of œâ is cofinal with œâ, as diagrams in œâ+1.

Each maximal left ideal of R contains r.

Alternatively, J(R) is the intersection of all maximal left ideals of R.
J(R) is the intersection of all maximal right ideals of R.
J(R) is a 2-sided ideal in R.
The rings for which J(R)=0 are called semiprimitive rings.
Given any ring R, the quotient R/J(R) is semiprimitive.

The Jacobson radical of a local prefield ring is the set of zero divisors.
Let V be a shift space of some order.
Let T:V‚ÜíV be a shift map.
It is simplest to start with the non-zero vectors, V‚àñ{0}.
Define a homotopy H:[0,1]√ó(V‚àñ{0})‚ÜíV‚àñ{0} by H t(v)=(1‚àít)v+tTv.
Then we define a homotopy G:[0,1]√ó(V‚àñ{0})‚ÜíV‚àñ{0} by G t(v)=(1‚àít)Tv+tv 0.
Combining these two homotopies results in the desired contraction of V‚àñ{0}.
If the third property is not required, one speaks of a seminorm.

This article is about ends (and coends) in category theory.
For ends in topology, see at end compactification.
These concepts are fundamental in enriched category theory.
The notion of coend is dual to the notion of end.
Let F:C op√óC‚ÜíX be a functor.
Then we define the end as follows:
Let F:C op√óC‚ÜíX be a functor.
In more detail, suppose C and X are categories.
(For coends one uses x hom(c,d) instead.)
This immediately implies a Fubini theorem for ends and coends.
Now we motivate and define the end in enriched category theory in terms of equalizers.
That leads to the following definition.
Let the enriching category be ùí±= Set.
Any continuous functor preserves ends, and any cocontinuous functor preserves coends.
This has a terminal object, namely (e‚ÜíIde).
This statement is sometimes called the co-Yoneda lemma.
Ordinary limits commute with each other, if both limits exist separately.
The analogous statement does hold for ends and coends.
Let ùíú and ‚Ñ¨ be small ùí±-enriched categories.
Let T:(ùíú‚äó‚Ñ¨) op‚äó(ùíú‚äó‚Ñ¨)‚Üíùí± be a ùí±-enriched functor.
Then we have [C,D](F,G)=‚à´ c‚ààCD(F(c),G(c)).
See Kan extension for more details.
A special case of the example of Kan extension is that of geometric realization.
So by the Yoneda lemma, we have F(c)‚âÉ‚à´ c‚Ä≤‚ààCC(c,c‚Ä≤)√óF(c‚Ä≤).

This also shows the equivalence of (1) and (3).
The equivalence of (4) and (5) is by definition.
Therefore continuity of the pullback functor translates to continuity of j.
This shows that (4) implies (2).
Conversely, assume (3).
By the adjoint functor theorem for Grothendieck toposes, statement (4) follows.
These relations follow from playing around with the adjunction.

The subspaces in a stratification are also called strata.
It is often convenient to construct stratifications by constructing their characteristic map.
(Such (characteristic,conservative)-factorizations are essentially unique.)
The example shows that any poset-stratification determines a unique stratification.
However, many poset-stratifications may determine the same stratification in this way.
The functor has a right inverse, as follows.
We obtain a functor ‚à•‚àí‚à•:Pos‚ÜíStrat.
Every classifying stratification is frontier-constructible (Rmk. ).
It makes sense to further terminologically distinguish maps of stratifications as follows.
Just as spaces have fundamental ‚àû-groupoids, stratified spaces also have ‚Äúfundamental categories‚Äù.
(The table is further explained below.)
We describe two simple ways of constructing/presenting fundamental ‚àû-posets below.

In fact, n-posets are the same as (n‚àí1,‚àû)-categories.
Fix a meaning of (‚àû,‚àû)-category, however weak or strict you wish.

Every isomorphism is both an epimorphism and a monomorphism.
The epimorphisms in the category Set of sets are precisely the surjective functions.
Often, though, the surjections correspond to a stronger notion of epimorphism.
But beware that the converse fails:
See this Prop. for proof.
See this Prop. for proof.
If gf is an epimorphism, so is g.
Let h 1,h 2:b‚Üíc be two morphisms such that ‚Üíg‚Üíh 1=‚Üíg‚Üíh 2.
Then by the commutativity of the diagram also x‚Üíy‚Üíb‚Üíh 1c equals x‚Üíy‚Üíb‚Üíh 2c.
But this means that h 1 and h 2 define the same cocone.
Let F:ùíû‚ü∂ùíü be a faithful functor.
We need to show that then f itself is an epimorphism.
So consider morphisms g,h:y‚ü∂z such that g‚àòf=h‚àòf.
Here is another: Proposition
Any morphism to an initial object is an epimorphism.
The coproduct of epimorphisms is an epimorphism.
For the first suppose 0‚ààC is initial and f:x‚Üí0.
Since f 1 is epic we conclude g‚àòi 1=h‚àòi 1.
Similarly we have g‚àòi 2=h‚àòi 2.
The following discussion may be helpful in this regard.
Also worth noting are:
Thus, in general, the two serious distinctions come
(The plain epimorphisms are the surjective continuous functions.)
However, the distinction is real.

An important early example of a temporal logic is given by Arthur Prior‚Äòs tense logic.
The reason for the notation F and P should be clear.
The dual of F is G, so Gœï=¬¨F¬¨œï.
In other words R P should be the converse or opposite relation of R F.
We could have models with ‚Äòcircular time‚Äô, and ‚Äòbranching time‚Äô.
It is possible to specify a temporal type theory in the context of adjoint logic.
Now consider for the moment that C and D are propositions.
Similarly, interchanging b and e, we find P‚ä£G.
Note that we don‚Äôt have to assume the classical principle Gœï=¬¨F¬¨œï and Hœï=¬¨P¬¨œï.
Some have also considered hybrid approaches (Balb11).
In our current framework we have Œ±CŒ≤:‚â°Œ£ c(p *Œ±√óq *Œ≤).
In other words, we could take Time to be a semicategory.
This suggests a temporal interpretation of ‚ñ° that is naturally formalised by using reflexive orderings.
The same interpretation is adopted in the logic of concurrent programs to be discussed.
This allows for quantification, both universal and existential, over paths.
We want to solve this by a fixed point argument/Picard iteration.

Axioms for ùí±-enriched Grothendieck topologies are introduced in terms of ùí±-subfunctors of representable functors.
Let ùíû be a small ùí±-enriched category.
Write [ùíû op,ùí±] and [ùíû,ùí±] for the enriched functor categories.
This is also called Isbell duality.
Objects which are preserved by ùí™‚àòSpec or Specùí™ are called Isbell self-dual.
The proof is mostly a tautology after the notation is unwound.
We therefore spell out several proofs.
Under certain circumstances, Isbell duality can be extended to large ùí±-enriched categories C.
We can apply these ideas to get the functors involved in Isbell duality.
Isbell duality says that these are adjoint functors: Y is right adjoint to Z.
All representables are Isbell self-dual.
Isbell duality is a template for many other space/algebra-dualities in mathematics.
Let ùí± be any cartesian closed category.
The first step that is not a definition is the Yoneda lemma.

There are various ways to deal with size issues in the foundations of mathematics.
All of them involve the notion of universe in one way or another.
Let X be a topological space and ùí∞ an open cover thereof.
The Schedule Theorem says that this can be done continuously over all paths in X.
To make this precise, we start with a set of labels.
Following Dyer and Eilenberg, let us write this as A.
The schedule monoid of A is the free monoid on the set A√óT.
Its elements are schedules in A.
There are two notions of length for a schedule.
There is the word length which simply counts the number of pairs.
The set of reduced schedules forms a submonoid of SA which is written RSA.
The empty schedule is reduced.
Then SA is topologised by taking the coproduct over the set of words in A.
The reduced schedule monoid is topologised as the quotient of this.
Let X be a topological space.
Let PX denotes its Moore path space.
Suppose that we have a family ùí∞ of subsets of X indexed by some set A.
We make that precise as follows.
Let Œ± i be the ith segment.
We can now state the main theorem.
Let X be a topological space.
The first condition is purely about the covering.
Here, Œõ‚ààRSA is the empty word.
Let p:Y‚ÜíB be a continuous function.
Then p is a fibration.
Let X be a topological space.
Let us write A * for the free monoid on A.
We need an initial technical result.
Let us explain why this is a reasonable result.
Consider a path, Œ±, of length l.
We pull back the cover ùí∞ to a cover of [0,l].
Choose n big enough so that l/n is less than this minimum length.
Thus the sets Y s‚âî{Œ±:Œ±‚Äñ es} cover PX.
What is more complicated is reducing the family to a locally finite one.
Thus each Œ± is contained in the interior of some D b.
Now let us put a total ordering on A *.
Write these as Q i, with Q 0 as the zero function.
It has the required covering property since the interiors of the D b cover PX.
Thus there is the potential for forgetting information when passing to a representation.
This can be a good thing, but it might not be.
This is in line with other uses of the word faithful.
The representation œÅ is called faithful if its adjunct œÅÀú is a monomorphism.
Suppose that V is Œ∫-compact object for some cardinal Œ∫.
Proposition For G any algebraic group, then the regular representation is faithful.
Moreover, it has finite-dimensional faithful sub-representations.
The action is faithful if this function œÅÀú is injective.
(If V is a finite set then this is a symmetric group).
See at effective Lie groupoid for more on this.
The dual concept is initial algebra.
Define a coalgebra structure on Fx by FŒ∏:Fx‚ÜíFFx.
By terminality of x, there is a unique coalgebra map f:Fx‚Üíx.
We claim this is inverse to Œ∏.
To construct terminal coalgebras, the following result is useful and practical.
See Ad√°mek's theorem on terminal coalgebras? for an extension of this result.
Let œÄ n:L‚ÜíF n1 be the n th projection of the limiting cone.
We claim the coalgebra (L,Œ∏) is terminal.
Indeed, suppose (x,Œ∑:x‚ÜíFx) is any coalgebra.
Theorem The interval [0,1] is terminal in the category of coalgebras.
By iteration, this generates a behavior stream (x n,h n).
(More material can be found at coalgebra of the real interval.)
See Johnstone‚Äôs Elephant, section D.4.7, for an extended discussion.
The notion of terminal coalgebra may be categorified.

If œÜ is a relation from A to B we write œÜ:A‚Ü¨B.
(Thus SEAR respects the principle of equivalence.)
We write œÜ(x,y) when œÜ holds of x and y.
Axiom 1 basically says that relations are what we expect them to be intuitively.
It should remind the reader of the axiom of separation.
Here are some things we can do with them.
By Axiom 0, there exists a set A.
Using Axiom 2, let ‚àÖ be a tabulation of œÜ.
From now on we fix a particular set ‚àÖ having no elements.
There exists a set 1 which has exactly one element.
By Axiom 0, there exists a set A containing an element x.
Likewise, to every function g:1‚ÜíA there corresponds a unique element x‚ààA, by g(‚ãÜ)=x.
We define a subset of a set A to be a relation S:1‚Ü¨A.
If S(‚ãÜ,x) we write x‚ààS.
Combined with Axiom 1, this implies the following separation property.
The properties of tabulations immediately imply that B is a bijection.
The composite of functions is a function, and the identity relation is a function.
See also the section on Universes, below.
In both of these (meta-)categories, the isomorphisms are the bijections.
It is called the cartesian product of A and B.
In particular, Set has products.
By definition, we have an injection m:im(f)‚Ü™B.
It is easy to verify the rest.
This association happens via a specified relation between A and PA.
It follows that Set is a topos (and Rel is a power allegory).
Extensionality of functions implies that it is unique.
As usual, power sets also imply the existence of function sets.
It follows that Set is a cartesian closed category.
This produces bijections such as C A√óB‚âÖ(C A) B and P(A√óB)‚âÖ(PA) B.
We now construct quotient sets.
In particular, this axiom implies that Set has a natural numbers object.
Note also that Axiom 4 implies Axiom 0.
The final axiom of SEAR is somewhat trickier to motivate.
One way to motivate the collection axiom is as follows.
The set indexed by each element a‚ààA is M a={x‚ààX|M(a,x)}.
Let‚Äôs now unravel that.
The ghost of a relation A‚Ü¨U is even easier.
Thus, the ghost of a relation A‚Ü¨U is simply such a property.
We now kill U and inspect the ghostly remnants of this tabulation.
The latter remains to be gone more into.)
One thing that Axiom 5 is good for is the recursive construction of sets.
Axiom 5 allows us to do that.

By Diaconescu‚Äôs argument, Choice implies the logic is classical.
We may call SEAR interpreted in intuitionistic logic ISEAR.
We may call this variation of SEAR PSEAR.
We may call this variation of SEAR CSEAR.
Compare Erik Palmgren's constructive ETCS.
Therefore, bounded SEARC implies ETCS.
It follows that ETCS also implies bounded SEARC, so the two are equivalent.
It is fairly straightforward to construct a model of SEAR from a model of ZF.
Define A‚Ä≤={a‚ààA|‚àÉX.P(a,X)}.
let Œª a be the smallest such Œª.
Let Y be the union of this set.
Note the use of the axiom of foundation in addition to the axiom of replacement.
Conversely, from any model of SEAR one can construct a model of ZF.
The basic idea of this process is described at pure set.
Thus D satisfies the requirement of the ZF axiom of collection.
Every topos has an internal logic, which is a type theory.
Of course, if the topos is boolean, then the logic can be classical.
Making alternate primitive choices Three-sorted SEAR
Using pairs and subsets instead of relations
Sets and elements are as before.
Thus we have a typing declaration S‚äÜA.
We allow a typed equality predicate for subsets.
Axiom 0 is the same as before.
We define functions and their properties as before.
Using pairs and functions instead of relations
One could use functions instead of relations.
Sets and elements are as before.
Axiom 0 is the same as before.
Thus, the principle of unique choice holds.
However, we can also make equality into structure.
This is definitely not along the ‚Äúmore accessible to undergraduates‚Äù direction!
But it may sometimes be technically helpful.
Axiom 0 requires no modification.
Before stating the version of Axiom 2 we need some definitions.
The construction of ‚àÖ is just as in ordinary SEAR.
The same idea applies to all the other axioms.
In model theory, one could construct models of a particular theory C.
As a result, C is an elementarily topical dagger 2-poset.
Here, we construct a model of SEPS in the context of homotopy type theory.
An internal relation is a term R:Sub(A√óB).

If one changes the order, then the resulting map is contiguous:
Let œÜ,œà:K‚ÜíL be two simplicial maps between simplicial complexes.
Contiguity gives a constructive form of homotopy applicable to simplicial maps.
Set œày‚Ä≤=x for one such x.
The two maps œÜ KœÜ K‚Ä≤ and œàœà¬Ø‚Ä≤ are contiguous.
We have that œÜ K‚Ä≤ is clearly order reversing so œÜ K‚Ä≤x i‚Ä≥‚äÜœÜ K‚Ä≤x 0‚Ä≥.
Let y=œÜ¬ØœÜ K‚Ä≤x 0‚Ä≥, then for each x‚ààœÜ K‚Ä≤x 0‚Ä≥, xRy.
œÜ Kœà‚Ä≤ and œàœÜ L‚Ä≤ are contiguous.

A duoidal category is a category with two monoidal structures which interchange laxly.
If this map is an isomorphism, the duoidal category is called normal.
A virtual duoidal category is a pseudomonoid in the 2-category of multicategories.
The interchange transformation is built out of the braiding.
An equivalent definition is obtained by considering ‚ãÑ-monoids in the category of ‚ãÜ-comonoids.

This is manifestly the condition that N is projective.
Assuming the axiom of choice, a free module N‚âÉR (S) is projective.
By lemma this is a projective module.
We discuss the more explicit characterization of projective modules as direct summands of free modules.
Let KÀú‚ÜíK be a surjective homomorphism of modules and f:N‚ÜíK a homomorphism.
By lemma if N is a direct summand then it is projective.
So we need to show the converse.
Thefore if N is projective, there is a section s of œµ.
This exhibits N as a direct summand of F(U(N)).
In some cases this can be further strengthened:

As n ranges through (‚àí1),0,1,2,3,‚ãØ these factorization systems form an ‚àû-ary factorization system.
The left class is that of n-connected morphisms in H.
This appears as a remark in HTT, Example 5.2.8.16.
This appears as (Lurie, prop. 6.5.1.16(6)).
The analogous statement holds also for the n-connected map by Prop. .
The case n=‚àí1 A (-1)-truncated morphism is precisely a full and faithful morphism.
A (-1)-connected morphism is one whose homotopy fibers are inhabited.

Let f:X‚ÜíY and g:Y‚ÜíX be two morphisms.
An algebra X with these properties is called an inequality algebra.
Unless otherwise noted, all of the constructions in these examples should be predicative.
Instead of subgroups, use antisubgroups.
An antisubgroup A is normal if pq‚ààA whenever qp‚ààA.
The trivial antisubgroup is the ‚â†-complement of {1}.
Instead of ideals (of rings), use antiideals.
(Technically, these are antisubalgebras of the ring as a module over itself.)
Again we can omit ‚â†-openness by strengthening the nullary condition.
It follows that an antiideal A is proper iff 1‚ààA.
The trivial antiideal is the ‚â†-complement of {0}.
Note that a union of antisubalgebras is again an antisubalgebra.
In general, instead of congruence relations, use anticongruence relations.
The quotient map X‚Ü†X/K is also strongly extensional.
Similarly, a sequence X‚ÜífY‚ÜígZ is exact iff imf is the complement of akerg.
In principle, aimf should be the ‚â†-complement of imf.

Let ùíû be a k-linear graded category?.
Next we characterize the invertible sheaves on both varieties.
Let ùíû be a k-linear graded category.
Now we establish a bijection between the sets of points of the varieties.

Now we can get an isomorphism of the canonical ring?s of the varieties.
Note that S X k(ùí™ X)[‚àínk]‚âÉœâ X nk for any k.
To do this we characterize the Zariski topology ‚Äúcohomologically‚Äù.

Otherwise it is strictly directed (not to be confused with a directed object).
Then all objects are undirected since the interval is contractible.
Whether or not an object is undirected depends on the choice of interval object.
Every object is pt-undirected.
We distinguish irrational and rational numbers; complex numbers divide into algebraic and transcendental.
The periods form a subring of complex numbers bigger than the field of algebraic numbers.
There are several operations which lead to new periods.

Idea Quiv or DiGraph is the category of quivers or directed graphs.
In other words, Quiv is the functor category from X op to Set.
The terminal object is the graph 1 with one vertex and one edge.
On vertices: œá X maps vertices of Y not in X to ‚àÖ.
This is represented in Œ© by two vertices.
œá X maps edges with only the source vertex in X to x.
œá X maps edges with only the target vertex in X to y.
The negation ¬¨:Œ©‚ÜíŒ© is defined as the characteristic map of ‚ä•:1‚ÜíŒ©.
Thus, all loops at ‚Ä¢ must go to the loop empty.
Suppose that a quiver X has a pair of parallel edges w,z.

The space of density matrices inside all suitable endomorphisms is called the Bloch region.
More specifically, a mixed state is often described as an ensemble of quantum systems.
The expectation value of A over the state |œà Œ±‚ü© is ‚ü®A‚ü© Œ±=‚ü®œà Œ±|A|œà Œ±‚ü©.
Density matrices that possess non-zero off-diagonal terms represent superposition states.
Any physical process that has the effect of suppressing the coherences is known as decoherence.
Moreover, every mixed state comes from the partial trace of a pure state.
Expand œÅ as œÅ=‚àë Œ±œÅ Œ±|œà Œ±‚ü©‚ü®œà Œ±|.
Hence, we can consider the state œÅÀú=‚àë Œ±œÅ Œ±|œà Œ±‚ü©‚äó‚ü®œà Œ±|‚ààV‚äóV *.
Tracing V * out of œÅÀú allows us to recover œÅ.

Congruences can be identified with enriched ‚Ä†-categories.
It is evidently a congruence.
If |I|=1, a congruence is the same as the ordinary internal notion of congruence.
In this case quotients and kernels reduce to the usual notions.
Call a congruence of this sort trivial (empty congruences are always trivial).
Let Œ∫ be an arity class.
As usual for arity classes, the cases of most interest have special names:
When Œ∫={1} we say unary.
When Œ∫=œâ is the set of finite cardinals, we say finitary.
When Œ∫ is the class of all cardinal numbers, we say infinitary.
There are also some other more technical characterizations; see Shulman 2012.
C is both exact and Œ∫-ary extensive.
The reflector is called exact completion.
C is regular iff it is unary regular.
C is coherent iff it is finitary regular.
C is infinitary-coherent iff it is infinitary regular.
C is exact iff it is unary exact.
C is a pretopos iff it is finitary exact.
C is an infinitary pretopos iff it is infinitary exact.
Any Œ∫-ary congruence that is a kernel has a quotient.

This defines a Galois connection on P(X).
A finiteness space is a set X equipped with a ùí∞‚äÜP(X) such that ùí∞=ùí∞ ‚ä•‚ä•.
Properties All finite subsets of X belong to ùí∞ ‚ä• for any ùí∞.
Thus, in a finiteness space all finite subsets are both finitary and cofinitary.
Any set of the form ùí∞ ‚ä• is closed under finite unions.
Taking ùí∞= all finite subsets of X gives a minimal finiteness structure on X.
Dually, taking ùí∞= all subsets of X gives a maximal finiteness structure.
The maximal and minimal finiteness structures are dual.
We cannot obtain any other finiteness spaces purely by cardinality restriction.
Then this is a finiteness space.
If v‚äÜY is cofinitary, then R ‚àí1[v]={x‚ààX‚à£‚àÉy‚ààv,xRy} is cofinitary.
FinSp rel is star-autonomous (see Ehrhard).
FinSp par is closed (see BCJS).
Let Set par denote the category of sets and partial functions.
Thus each f i becomes a morphism in FinSp par.
But then g ‚àí1(x)‚äÜg ‚àí1(f i ‚àí1(f i(x))), hence is cofinitary.
A similar argument shows that FinSp par has all inhabited limits.
Its objects are finiteness spaces.
We write this morphism in FinSp rel as supp(M):X‚ÜíY.
Any distributive lattice is a semiring with join as addition and meet as multiplication.
In the case R={‚ä•,‚ä§} the set of truth values, we have FMat(R)=FinSp rel.
This can be explained more abstractly as follows.
When M is a group G, this is the group algebra R[G].
Thus, both are special cases of arity spaces for two different sets of arities.
A quadratic irrational number is a quadratic number that is also irrational.
Every quadratic number field is a subfield of the complex quadratic numbers.
In every cohesive (‚àû,1)-topos there is an intrinsic notion of Chern-Weil theory.
They do however have natural realizations as smooth ‚àû-groups.
We give some examples of such fractional characteristic classes that occur in practice.
Here and in the following the boldface indicates smooth (or otherwise cohesive) refinements.
We write BString for the corresponding delooping ‚àû-Lie groupoid.
(See the first part of (SatiSchreiberStasheff II for a review).)
(This physical origin is after all the origin of the term spin structure .)
This refinement translates to differential refinements of the string structures and the fivebrane structures on X.
The following restates this in a bit more technical detail.
This String diff(X) we may call the ‚àû-groupoid of differential string-structures .
But suppose we fix an X such that H(X,BString) is nontrivial.
This is an example of the higher version of the Chern-Weil homomorphism.
These are the kind of structures that ‚àû-Chern-Weil theory studies.
Ordinary Chern-Weil theory is formulated in the context of differential geometry.
This model is constructed in terms of Lie integration of objects in ‚àû-Lie algebra cohomology.
This construction is the higher analog of the Chern-Weil homomorphism.

Here the basic assignment is that of algebras of observables to regions of spacetime.
However, this ‚Äúnaive‚Äù generalization is not quite refined enough.
But it is still not quite the fully general functorial formalization of quantum field theory.
In basic quantum mechanics one also demands that U(t,t)=id.
But the equivalent formulation above in terms of locality of U(‚àí,‚àí) is noteworthy.
This we come to below.
Besides the time evolution, there is the theory of composite systems.
These Cartesian products and tensor products extend to morphisms.

However, the hypercompletion ùí≥ ‚àß of ùí≥ will have enough points.

These monoids are equivalently differential graded algebras.
The A-modules of this form are called free modules.
This natural bijection between f and fÀú establishes the adjunction.
To that end, we check the universal property of the coequalizer:
Hence the diagram says that œï‚àòŒº=f, which we needed to show.
The commutativity of this diagram says that q=œï. Definition
Then consider the two conditions on the unit e E:A‚ü∂E.
By commutativity and associativity it follows that Œº E coequalizes the two induced morphisms E‚äóA‚äóEAA‚ü∂‚ü∂E‚äóE.
In this form the statement is also known as Yoneda reduction.

This result also classifies all TQFT functors on 2Cob.
Frobenius algebra in these cases will be replaced by a braided Hopf algebra.
This motivates the question: ‚Äúwhich weight systems are quantum states?‚Äù
In mathematics very often these groups do not vanish right away.
(Based on arxiv.org/abs/2103.01877).
This is accomplished using tools and theorems from the mathematical field of algebraic topology.
They enable new devices that operate at high speed with very low energy consumption.
I will divide my talk into two parts.
Quantum Mechanics offers phenomena which defy our everyday observation.
Trapped ions are one of the promising platform for quantum computing and sensing.
As a quantum system, trapped ions offer several advantages.
Trapped ions also have great potential as quantum sensors.
One of the major challenges facing trapped ion systems is scalability.
Realization of such devices is not far away.
Sensitive physical measurements are an essential component of modern science and technology.
Developments in quantum sensors will outdate their classical counterparts.
Here we revisit the definition of the Wilson loop operators and MESs.
‚ÄúQuantum hardware needs quantum software‚Äù, so to say.
Our framework can be implemented in polynomial time for a wide variety of quantum circuits.

Quasi-elliptic cohomology is closely related to Tate K-theory.

We also explore the relation of the theory to the Tate curve.
This is joint work with Matthew Young.
This is the bulk-boundary correspondence of the title.
We will give a brief introduction to the subject of Applied and Computational Topology.
Various deformation quantizations of the algebra of functions have been constructed.
We will illustrate our results with examples from Poisson geometry and quantum groups.
The study of topological spaces with continuous functions up to homotopy is called homotopy theory.
Interestingly, this plays an even more fundamental role in mathematics.
For some introductory exposition see at Higher Structures in Mathematics and Physics.
This approach to homotopy theory is called algebraic topology.
But there are more interesting and richer homotopy invariants of topological spaces.
The collection of these tangent spaces forms a vector bundle called the tangent bundle.
The graphics on the right shows one tangent space to the 2-sphere.
We now say some of this again, at a slightly more technical level.
This simple construction turns out to yield remarkably useful groups of homotopy invariants.
As such it is represented by a spectrum.
For k=‚ÑÇ this is called KU, for k=‚Ñù this is called KO.
(There is also the unification of both in KR-theory.)
For k=‚Ñù the periodicity is 8, for k=‚ÑÇ it is 2.
This is called Bott periodicity.
As the terminology indicates, both spin geometry and Dirac operator originate in physics.
Now Dirac operators are generalized to Fredholm operators.
Consider an interval in a topological space X, namely a continuous map œÉ:[0,1]‚ÜíX.
Its boundary is the two endpoints œÉ(0):*‚ÜíX and œÉ(1):*toX.
Similarly a formal sum of points is then called a 0-chain.
Clearly, it is measure for the connected components of X.
It satisfies the fundamental identity that The boundary of a boundary vanishes, ‚àÇ‚àò‚àÇ=0.
This section reviews some basic notions in topology and homotopy theory.
These will all serve as blueprints for corresponding notions in homological algebra.
For n=0 this is the point, Œî 0=*.
For n=1 this is the standard interval object Œî 1=[0,1].
For n=2 this is the filled triangle.
For n=3 this is the filled tetrahedron.
Topological spaces with continuous maps between them form the category Top.
This notion of based homotopy is an equivalence relation.
It is also a special case of the general discussion at homotopy.
This construction has a fairly straightforward generalizations to ‚Äúhigher dimensional loops‚Äù.
Let X be a topological space and x:*‚ÜíX a point.
The 0th homotopy group is taken to be the set of connected components.
Reflexivity and transitivity are trivially checked.
But we can consider the genuine equivalence relation generated by weak homotopy equivalence:
(This data is called a Postnikov tower of X.)
This construction makes the sets of simplices into abelian groups.
By linearity, it is sufficient to check this on a basis element œÉ‚ààS n.
Let X be a topological space.
Let œÉ 2:Œî 2‚ÜíX be a singular 2-chain.
This generality we come to below in the next section.
For X a connected, orientable manifold of dimension n we have H n(X)‚âÉ‚Ñ§.
The precise choice of this isomorphism is a choice of orientation on X.
This is called the push-forward of œÉ along f.
From this the statement follows since ‚Ñ§[‚àí]:sSet‚ÜísAb is a functor.
Therefore we have an ‚Äúabelianized analog‚Äù of the notion of topological space:
Composition of such chain maps is given by degreewise composition of their components.
In particular for each n‚àà‚Ñï singular homology extends to a functor H n(‚àí):Top‚ÜíAb.
We therefore also have an ‚Äúabelian analog‚Äù of weak homotopy equivalences:
In summary: chain homology sends weak homotopy equivalences to quasi-isomorphisms.
This clearly induces an isomorphism on all homology groups.
This is made precise by the central notion of the derived category of chain complexes.
We turn to this below in section Derived categories and derived functors.
But quasi-isomorphisms are a little coarser than weak homotopy equivalences.
First we need a comparison map:
Its kernel is the commutator subgroup of œÄ 1(X,x).
This is known as the Hurewicz theorem.
Then one speaks of vector bundles.
Some vector bundles are ‚Äútautological‚Äù.
It is possible to take this construction and allow n to go to infinity.
In the following we take Top to denote compactly generated topological spaces.
For these the Cartesian product X√ó(‚àí) is a left adjoint and hence preserves colimits.
Similarly the nth complex Grassmannian of ‚ÑÇ k is the coset topological space.
As such this is the standard presentation for the O(n)-universal principal bundle.
Its base space BO(n) is the corresponding classifying space.
Consider the coset quotient projection O(k‚àín)‚ü∂O(k)‚ü∂O(k)/O(k‚àín)=V n(‚Ñù k).
This implies the claim.
Consider the coset quotient projection U(k‚àín)‚ü∂U(k)‚ü∂U(k)/U(k‚àín)=V n(‚ÑÇ k).
The colimiting space EO(n)=lim‚ü∂ kV n(‚Ñù k) from def. is weakly contractible.
The same kind of argument applies to the complex case.
Hence also the to morphisms is an isomorphism.
The claim in then follows since (this exmpl.) O(n+1)/O(n)‚âÉS n.
This is called the Grothendieck group construction.
In fact K(X) has more structure than just that of an abelian group.
The tensor product of vector bundles makes it a ring.
This involves noticing a list of useful properties satisfied by these functors.
This is most useful for computing generalized cohomology groups.
Write Top CW */ for the corresponding category of pointed topological spaces.
Write Ab ‚Ñ§ for the category of integer-graded abelian groups.
We may rephrase this more intrinsically and more generally:
Let ùíû be an (‚àû,1)-category with (‚àû,1)-pushouts, and with a zero object 0‚ààùíû.
Write Œ£:ùíû‚Üíùíû:X‚Ü¶0‚äîX0 for the corresponding suspension (‚àû,1)-functor.
We identify Top CW‚Ü™Top CW ‚Ü™ by X‚Ü¶(X,‚àÖ).
Hence the excision axiom implies E ‚Ä¢(X,B)‚ü∂‚âÉE ‚Ä¢(A,A‚à©B).
Conversely, suppose E ‚Ä¢ satisfies the alternative condition.
Let E ‚Ä¢ be an cohomology theory, def. , and let A‚Ü™X.
Consider U‚âî(Cone(A)‚àíA√ó{0})‚Ü™Cone(A), the cone on A minus the base A.
Let E ‚Ä¢ be an unreduced cohomology theory, def. .
Define a reduced cohomology theory, def. (EÀú ‚Ä¢,œÉ) as follows.
This is clearly functorial.
By lemma we have an isomorphism EÀú ‚Ä¢(X‚à™Cone(A))=E ‚Ä¢(X‚à™Cone(A),{*})‚ü∂‚âÉE ‚Ä¢(X,A).
Hence the left vertical sequence is exact.
Let (EÀú ‚Ä¢,œÉ) be a reduced cohomology theory, def. .
The construction in def. indeed yields an unreduced cohomology theory.
Proof Exactness holds by prop. .
For excision, it is sufficient to consider the alternative formulation of lemma .
For CW-inclusions, this follows immediately with lemma .
That however is isomorphic to the unreduced mapping cone of the original inclusion.
With this the natural isomorphism is given by lemma .
As before, this is isomorphic to the unreduced mapping cone of the point inclusion.
Finally we record the following basic relation between reduced and unreduced cohomology:
Hence this is a split exact sequence and the statement follows.
This is called the clutching construction.
This is very useful for computations.
This has dramatic consequences, which we see when we discuss the Adams operations below.
In fact its ring structure makes it a multiplicative cohomology theory.
This makes K an even periodic cohomology theory.
But in fact there are yet more operations on vector bundles.
We observe their basic properties, which make them most useful for characterizing topological spaces.
This is the next topic.
We saw how topological K-theory arises from pairing topology with linear algebra.
There are variaous further refinements of topological K-theory obtained by refining these ingredients.
This now pairs topology with representation theory.
We include it for completeness and as outlook.
A œÉ-orientation is an orientation in generalized cohomology for elliptic cohomology.
A universal such orientation is a string orientation of tmf.

Regardless, every subset A of X has both an outer measure?
The a subset of X is measurable if it belongs to ‚Ñ≥.

Lemma (fiber-wise diagonal of covering space is open and closed)
Let E‚ÜípX be a covering space.
First to see that it is an open subset.
It follows that U p(e)√ó{e}‚äÇE is an open neighbourhood.
These are disjoint by the assumption that e 1‚â†e 2.
We discuss left lifting properties satisfied by covering spaces.
This is the statement to be proven.
Let p:E‚ÜíX be any covering space.
Now the lifting condition explicitly fixes pr 1(Œ≥^)=Œ≥.
This shows the statement for the case of trivial covering spaces.
Now consider any covering space p:E‚ÜíX.
Consider such a choice {U x‚äÇX} x‚ààX.
This is an open cover of X.
Now assume that Œ≥^| [0,t j] has been found.
By induction over j, this yields the required lift Œ≥^.
Therefore also the total lift is unique.
Altrnatively, uniqueness of the lifts is a special case of lemma .
This is the required lift.
says that covering projections are in particular Hurewicz fibrations.
Let p:E‚ÜíX be a covering space.
With this the statement follows from .
Then the following are equivalent:
The implication 1)‚áí2) is immediate.
We need to show that the second statement already implies the first.
Therefore f^(y‚Ä≤)‚âîf‚àòŒ≥^(1) is a lift of f(y‚Ä≤).
This will prove the claim.
Hence let Œ≥‚Ä≤:[0,1]‚ÜíY be another path in Y that connects y with y‚Ä≤.
We need to show that then f‚àòŒ≥‚Ä≤^=f‚àòŒ≥^.
But Œ≥‚Ä≤‚ãÖ(Œ≥¬Ø‚Ä≤‚ãÖŒ≥) is homotopic (via reparameterization) to just Œ≥.
This shows that the above prescription for f^ is well defined.
It only remains to show that the function f^ obtained this way is continuous.
Let y‚Ä≤‚ààY be a point and W f^(y‚Ä≤)‚äÇE an open neighbourhood of its image in E.
Let U f(y‚Ä≤)‚äÇX be an open neighbourhood over which p trivializes.
This shows that the lifted function is continuous.
Finally that this continuous lift is unique is the statement of lemma .
Let X be a topological space and E‚ÜípX a covering space.

The usual notions of full functors and faithful functors can be generalized to anafunctors.
Anafunctors can be composed via pullback.

The quark confinement conjecture is experimentally well tested, but mathematically still unproven.
And it is still unknown which combinations of quarks may or may not form hadrons.
Experimental guidance is needed to help improving theoretical models.
QCD and its relatives are special because QCD is the theory of nature.
It does not capture drastic rearrangement of the vacuum structure related to confinement.

Relations between gauge fields and strings present an old, fascinating and unanswered question.
The full answer to this question is of great importance for theoretical physics.
Moreover, in the SU(N) gauge theory the strings interaction is weak at large N.
The challenge is to build a precise theory on the string side of this duality.
This is, however, very different from the picture of strings as flux lines.
Interestingly, even now people often don‚Äôt distinguish between these approaches.
However there are cases in which t‚ÄôHooft‚Äôs mechanism is really working.

Use the LaTeX syntax where possible.
A central point of the nLab is that information is linked.
Ideally, each and every keyword would be hyperlinked, certainly when it occurs first.
Don‚Äôt assume that the reader has the same background as you have.
Typically each author decides on his or her own.
Note that the tag must be placed at the end.
Strangely single bracket link texts allow math expressions while double bracket texts don‚Äôt.
produces Set ‚Üí vs Set ‚Üí vs Set ‚Üí .
Note that these tags must be at the start of the text.
See equation (eq-colon-SomeEquation).
Only word characters are allowed in LaTeX display labels.
In particular, the hyphen character - cannot be used.
This is in contrast to labels for theorem environments.
This is due to use of different parsers.
How to make comments and ask questions
In general, the place to make comments and ask questions is at the nForum.
Just add a comment to the thread.

In logic, logical disjunction is the join in the poset of truth values.
Disjunction also exists in nearly every non-classical logic.
Disjunction is de Morgan dual to conjunction.
Disjunction also has an identity element, which is the false truth value.
Some logics allow a notion of infinitary disjunction.
Indexed disjunction is existential quantification.
Note that ¬¨P‚àß¬¨Q is the negation of every item in this diagram.
For this reason, ¬¨(¬¨P‚àß¬¨Q) is sometimes called classical disjunction.

is a morphism of Lawvere theories ab T:ùíúùí∑‚ÜíT.
This functor is a right adjoint.
The first condition is trivial, since all objects are fibrant.
Such objects are modeled by the model structure on simplicial presheaves on C.
In the remainder of this section we assume such a choice to be fixed.
Below in the section on Examples and applications we discuss concrete choices of interest.
The adjunction that we shall be concerned with is essentially Isbell conjugation.
We recall some basics of Function T-algebras on presheaves.
This is what the following definition deals with.
We call ùí™(X)‚ààTAlg op the T-algebra of functions on X.
This extends to a functor ùí™:[C op,sSet]‚Üí(TAlg Œî) op.
Let S‚äÇmor[C op,sSet] be a class of split hypercovers.
This establishes that j is a right Quillen functor and completes the proof.
Regard f as a simplicial object in the overcategory Sh(C)/X‚âÉSh(C/X).
We obtain a proof of this after the following discussions.
Remark The resulting localization modality Specùí™ we might call the affine modality.
It is similar to exhibiting C as a total category.
The following proposition provides a model for these Eilenberg-MacLane objects.
This is essentially the argument of (To√´n, corollary 2.2.6).
Hence by the general properties of transferred model structures, also TAlg proj Œî is.
Hence L is the full sub-(‚àû,1)-category of H on R-local objects.
Set H‚âîSh (‚àû,1)(C).
By construction ùí™ is a colimit-preserving (‚àû,1)-functor between locally presentable (‚àû,1)-categories.
Accordingly, by the adjoint (‚àû,1)-functor theorem is has a right adjoint (‚àû,1)-functor.
This is given by Spec(A):U‚Ü¶(cdgAlg k op) ‚àò(U,A).
In this case the adjunction is that considered in (To√´n).
This is what we discuss in more detail below.
Write SmoothAlg‚âîTAlg for the category of smooth algebras.

Both are special cases of a model structure on enriched categories.
; the induced functor œÄ 0(F):Ho(C)‚ÜíHo(D) on homotopy categories is an isofibration.
A reference for right properness is (Bergner 04, prop. 3.5).
In this case X is also called a G-torsor.
First we show that Aut G(X) acts freely on X.
But then G-equivariance implies that œï(y)=œï(g*x)=g*œï(x)=g*x=y.
For example, the five Platonic solids may be represented as regular combinatorial maps.
In homotopy type theory We discuss regular actions via homotopy type theory.
Restriction to 1-groups is unnecessary here, and we say
An ‚àû-action of an ‚àû-group is a regular ‚àû-action if its homotopy quotient is contractible.
First, we need to argue that X(*) is merely inhabited.
Since X is regular, we have ‚àë (b:BG)X(b) contractible.
This gives a center of contraction (b,x).
Again, we first show that X(*) is merely inhabited.
The total space of XÀú has center of contraction (P,p 0).
Now ‚ÄñX(*)‚Äñ follows from p 0:P(*).
This gives us the center of contraction (*,x 0).
However, now we get to use that BG is connected.

(open subgroups of topological groups are closed)
The set of H-cosets is a cover of G by disjoint open subsets.
Any localic subgroup of a localic group is closed (see this Theorem).
This is not of much practical importance, but of large theoretical importance.
There are probably many proofs of this statement.
The following (originally written up here) is more uniform (and constructive).
Suppose i:H‚Ü™G is a monic epi.

A Cartesian space ‚Ñù n carries a unique structure of a convenient vector space.

This is to a large degree the motivating example.
It makes the category of convenient vector spaces be Cartesian closed.
Suppose V is a vector space over a field K.
It is also denoted ‚ãÄV, ‚ãÄ ‚Ä¢V, or AltV.

A directed set is a set equipped with a direction.

The inclusion of this subcategory is final, but not homotopy final.
Amazingly, this version needs no modification to become homotopical.

The Emerton-Gee stack is the moduli stack of √©tale (œÜ,Œì)-modules.

f is connected, i.e. f * is fully faithful.

Hence in that case we have the following simpler definition.
Another term for this: we say 1 is tiny (atomic).
This appears in (Shulman).
Every local topos is a retract of a Freyd cover.
This appears as (Johnstone, lemma C3.6.4).
Since it is a right adjoint it preserves the terminal object.
Since Œì(X)‚âÉHom(*,X) (see global section geometric morphism), the claim follows.
Remark In a topos every epimorphism is an effective epimorphism.
Therefore X‚Üí* being an epi means that X is a (-1)-connected object.
The same is true for any local (infinity,1)-topos.
See concrete sheaf for details.
We discuss first the setup and then the axioms themselves.
This appears as (AwodeyBirkedal, lemma 2.3).
Axiom 1. j is essential.
Axiom 4. Discrete objects are closed under binary products.
These axioms characterize local geometric morphisms ‚Ñ∞‚ÜíSh j(‚Ñ∞)‚âÉD j(‚Ñ∞).
Therefore Œì preserves all colimits.
Hence by the adjoint functor theorem it has a further right adjoint CoDisc.
The converse to prop. is true if C is Cauchy complete.
For instance CartSp is a local site.
Objects in Sh(C) are generalized smooth spaces such as diffeological spaces.
Of course, this is the origin of the terminology.
We check that the global section geometric morphism Œì:‚Ñ∞/X‚ÜíSet preserves colimits.
Moreover, overserve that colimits in the over category are computed in ‚Ñ∞.
So Œì does commute with colimits if X is tiny.

Let (X,œÑ) be a compact topological space.
Then every net in X has a convergent subnet.
Proof Let ŒΩ:A‚ÜíX be a net.
We need to show that there is a subnet which converges.
To this end, we first need to build the domain directed set B.
It is clear B is a preordered set.
Hence with U bd‚âîU 1‚à©U 2 we have obtained the required pair.
Hence we have defined a subnet ŒΩ‚àòf.
Hence assume that (X,œÑ) is not compact.
We need to produce a net without a convergent subnet.
Consider then P fin(I), the set of finite subsets of I.
We will show that this net has no converging subnet.
This would imply that x J‚â†U x for all J‚äÉ{i x}.
This hence satisfies both ŒΩ f(e)‚ààU x as well as {i x}‚äÇf(b 1)‚äÇf(b).
Thus we have a proof by contradiction.
In constructive mathematics, this statement is equivalent to excluded middle.
Every inhabited subset of {0,1} is a directed poset.
: this means that a‚â§Œ≤(a,b) and b‚â§Œ≤(a,b).
Thus the subset inclusion i:P‚Ü™{0,1} is a net.
If x=0, then suppose that 1‚ààP.
Thus, the law of excluded middle is true for all propositions p.
This has a monoid structure (up to homotopy) given by concatenation of loops.

However, we can also simplify the requisite axioms in this presentation.

Well that‚Äôs rubbish isn‚Äôt it.
But I find an affine module of a rig to be a trickier concept.

Yes, that would be an affine ‚Ñï-module.
Affine spaces typically serve as local models for more general kinds of spaces.
Similarly, in algebraic geometry a scheme is locally isomorphic to an affine scheme.

The function e can be thought of as a measure of equality.
Such morphisms r are called relations between H-valued sets.
Then, in the unitary tabular allegory, split equivalence relations.
Of course, the topos obtained from a tripos has an internal logic.

Definition The following is a somewhat terse account.
Colimits of larger cardinality are sometimes required for the small object argument, however.
There are several extra conditions that strengthen the notion of a model category:
A cofibrantly generated model category is one with a good compatible notion of cell complexes.
Semimodel categories relax some of the conditions on lifting properties.
Weak model categories relax these conditions even further.
We need to show that then also f‚ààW.
First consider the case that f‚ààFib.
In this case, factor w as a cofibration followed by an acyclic fibration.
This now exhibits f as a retract of an acyclic fibration.
These are closed under retract by this prop..

A measure space is a measurable space equipped with a measure.
The motivating example is Lebesgue measure on the unit interval.
Let (X,Œ£) be a measurable space.
Œº is increasing: Œº(A)‚â§Œº(B) if A‚äÜB.
The measure of the empty set is zero: Œº(‚àÖ)=0;

But until someone suggests a useful example, we will leave this to the centipedes.
The countable additivity condition should now be modified to require ‚ãÉ i‚ààIS i‚ààŒ£‚Ä≤.
Notice that ‚àí‚àû is not allowed as a value for a signed measure.
It would work just as well to allow ‚àí‚àû and forbid ‚àû.
Yet another possibility is to drop countable additivity, replacing it with finite additivity.
A measure is complete if every full set is measurable.
Again, we don't have to bother with S in a positive measure space.
In the following, ‚Äòmeasurable‚Äô will mean Œº-measurable.
That is, we assume that Œº is complete and identify Œº-equivalent functions.
A measurable function f is integrable with respect to Œº if this integral converges.
If it is, then we say that f is absolutely integrable.
We can then define the integral of f; we always have ‚Äñ‚à´fŒº‚Äñ‚â§‚à´‚Äñf‚ÄñŒº.
I need to check HAF for more details here in the general case.
We have (fg)Œº=f(gŒº).

Properties The universal central extension of a perfect group is also perfect.
This follows directly from the universal central extension being a Schur-trivial group.
Hodge theory also applies in combinatorics, for instance to matroids (Huh 22).
This basic setup is however by now vastly generalized.
The nomenclature ‚Äúnonabelian‚Äù/‚Äúnoncommutative‚Äù Hodge theory may be confusing - to clarify:
The coefficients in noncommutative Hodge theory are abelian.
Clearly, if |I|=1 this reduces to the usual notion of orthogonality for morphisms.
Note there is no restriction on the sinks involved to be small.
The dual notion is a factorization structure for cosinks (‚Äúsources‚Äù).
Dually, if p is an opfibration, we can lift factorization structures for cosinks.
Properties M consists of monics

This is additional structure not present in theory of smooth spaces.
The idea of √©tale morphisms can be axiomatized in any topos.
This idea goes back to lectures by Andr√© Joyal in the 1970s.

If we drop separation, then we get pseudometric spaces.
If we drop the symmetry condition, then we get quasimetric spaces.
(This include for example p-adic completions of number fields.)
Extended quasipseudoultrametric spaces can also be called Lawvere ultrametric spaces.
This is equivalently an (R ‚â•0,‚â•,+,0)-enriched set.
The restriction to ordinary metric spaces is denoted by Met ord.
Imposing the symmetry axiom then gives us enriched ‚Ä†-categories.
However, perhaps it makes more sense just to speak about enriched ‚Ä†-categories.)
But in fact this gives us nothing new, at least if we have symmetry.

If the terminal object is also initial, it is called a zero object.
Other notations for a terminal object include * and pt.
A terminal object may also be viewed as a limit over the empty diagram.
Conversely, a limit over any diagram is a terminal cone over that diagram.
Some examples of terminal objects in notable categories follow:
The terminal object of a poset is its top element, if it exists.
Any one-element set is a terminal object in the category Set.
The terminal object of Top is the point space.
The terminal object of Ring is the zero ring.

The group cohomology of a group G is the cohomology of its delooping BG.
This cohomology classifies group extensions of G.
Finally one can break this further down into components In
Let H be an (‚àû,1)-topos.
Let G‚ààGrp(H) be a group object, an ‚àû-group, in H.
Write BG‚ààH for its delooping.
Regarded as an object in the slice (‚àû,1)-topos H /BG
Write then ‚Ñ§[G]‚ààRing for the group algebra of G over the integers.
Write ùíú‚âî‚Ñ§[G]Mod for the category ‚Ñ§[G]Mod of modules over ‚Ñ§[G].
This decomposition gives rise to a Grothendieck spectral sequence for the group cohomology.
This is called the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence.
For emphasis we highlight these special cases separately.
This is presented by the standard model structure on simplicial sets, Disc‚àûGrpd‚âÉL whesSet.

Girard describes four levels of semantics: alethic, functional, interactive, and deontic.
The negatively first, alethic, is the layer of truth or models.
The negatively second, functional, is the layer of functions or categories.
The negatively third, interaction, is the layer of games or game semantics.
The negatively fourth, deontic, is the layer of normativity or formatting.
This is related to the distinction between existentialism and essentialism in philosophy.
We can obtain two alternative notions of typing:
This corresponds to types ‚Äú√† la Curry‚Äù where untyped computational objects are typed.
In this case, types are designed and not defined as primitive objects.
Getting rid of semantics
A major difference seems to be the starting point and the primitives considered.
This is something which can be considered in the transcendental syntax.
A logical system can then be extracted from these techniques.
Both can be typed and testing extends to any model of computation.
There is a canonical action of G + on Spec(L).
Studying this is the topic of chromatic homotopy theory.

So far, pure motives and mixed motives have only been defined conditionally.
Part of the formalism involves more general schemes than varieties.
Thus one has in fact an abelian tensor category of motives.
However, there exist candidate and conditional constructions which are useful in practice.
Traditionally, S is the spectrum of a field, often of characteristic zero.
Nori‚Äôs construction unconditionally produces a ‚Ñö-Tannakian category of mixed motives over any subfield of ‚ÑÇ.
Thus, the abelian category of motives always refers to motives with rational coefficients.
The first definition was proposed by Voevodksy in the mid 1990s.
The latter three are equivalent and support a full-fledged formalism of six operations.
It is known to agree with Voevodsky‚Äôs definition for fields of characteristic zero.
Definition SH(S) ‚Ñö + is the stable (‚àû,1)-category of Morel motives.
Thus, the other summand SH(S) ‚Ñö ‚àí only appears over formally real fields.
It is called the category of Witt motives.
The resulting (‚àû,1)-category is denoted DA et(S,‚Ñö).
The stable (‚àû,1)-category of Beilinson motives is the (‚àû,1)-category of modules over H B.
They have also shown that Beilinson/Morel motives are equivalent to Ayoub motives.
Correspondences are interesting in noncommutative geometry of the operator algebra flavour.
In birational geometry, Bruno Kahn defined the appropriate version.

There are two definitions of the Euler characteristic of a chain complex.
When both of these are defined, they are equal.
This is a consequence of the functoriality of the categorical definition (Definition ).
This definition is usually known as the Euler-Poincar√© formula.
Historically earlier was: Definition/Proposition
Let X be a finite CW-complex.
Write cell(X) k for the set of its k-cells.
Then the Euler characteristic of X is œá(X)=‚àë k‚àà‚Ñï(‚àí1) k|cell(X) k|.
All the definitions considered so far can be subsumed by the following general abstract one.
This subsumes the previous definitions as follows:
Thus we recover Def. .
A similar argument shows that its Euler characteristic is then computed as in Def. .
See around DoldPuppe, corollary 4.6).

K is 1-truncated if it has enough discretes.

It would be nice if the only (-2)-truncated Grothendieck 2-topos were Cat.
However, I don‚Äôt see a way to make this happen except by fiat.
The case n=1 gives classical Grothendieck toposes; the case n=(0,1) gives locales.

This page is an introduction to basic topological homotopy theory.
Of particular interest are homotopies between paths in a topological space.
This encodes an action or permutation representation of the fundamental group.
says that covering spaces are equivalently characterized by their monodromy representation of the fundamental group.
This is an incarnation of the general principle of Galois theory in topological homotopy theory.
We close with an outlook on these below.
Such ‚Äúcontinuous deformations‚Äù are called homotopies:
In the following we use this terminology:
Write Hom Top(X,Y) for the set of continuous functions from X to Y.
Hence the continuity follows by this example.
We indicate that a continuous function is a homotopy equivalence by writing X‚ü∂‚âÉ hY.
(homotopy equivalences are the isomorphisms in the homotopy category)
(homeomorphism is homotopy equivalence)
Every homeomorphism is a homotopy equivalence (def. ).
This is immediate from remark by general properties of categories and functors.
But for the record we spell it out.
(contractible topological spaces are the terminal objects in the homotopy category)
This is contractible (def. ): p:B n‚ü∂‚âÉ h*.
This is a homotopy by prop. .
The other composite is const 0‚àòp=const 0:B n‚ü∂B n.
Let X be a topological space and let x,y‚ààX be two points.
Let X be a topological space.
Prop. says that under concatenation of paths, this set is a group.
As such it is called the fundamental group of X at x.
Definition intentionally offers two variants of the definition.
The first, the fundamental groupoid is canonically given, without choosing a basepoint.
We discuss the concept of groupoids below.
(fundamental group is functor on pointed topological spaces)
This implies semi-local simply-connectedness.
(Euclidean space is simply connected)
So far this structure is what is called a small category.
Between groupoids with only a single object this is the same as a group homomorphism.
This makes precise how groupoid theory is a generalization of group theory.
This is obtained from ùíû simply by discarding all those morphisms that are not isomorphisms.
Let {ùí¢ i} i‚ààI be a set of groupoids.
The respect for identities is clear.
These two definitions coincide.
It first of all follows that the following makes sense
This is usually denoted Ho(Grpd).
Hence the fundamental groupoid is a homotopy invariant of topological spaces.
Let G be a group.
Let {G i} i‚ààI be a set of groups.
Proof The implication 2) ‚áí1) is immediate.
It is clear that both induces bijections on connected components.
since there is only a single object.
But this means F i,i and G j,j are group isomorphisms.
This is called a skeleton of ùí¢, see also at skeletal groupoid.
It is now sufficient to show that there are conjugations/natural isomorphisms p‚àòinc‚âÉidAAAAinc‚àòp‚âÉid.
Assuming the axiom of choice then the following are equivalent:
Here inc 1 and inc 2 are equivalences of groupoids by prop. .
It follows that also f is an isomorphism in Ho(Grpd).
Let X be a topological space.
Here are some basic properties of covering spaces:
Lemma (fiber-wise diagonal of covering space is open and closed)
Let E‚ÜípX be a covering space.
First to see that it is an open subset.
It follows that U p(e)√ó{e}‚äÇE is an open neighbourhood.
These are disjoint by the assumption that e 1‚â†e 2.
Such lifts of paths through covering projections is the topic of monodromy below.
Here it is of interest to consider the lifting problem subject to some constraint.
Let p:E‚ÜíX be any covering space.
Now the lifting condition explicitly fixes pr 1(Œ≥^)=Œ≥.
This shows the statement for the case of trivial covering spaces.
Now consider any covering space p:E‚ÜíX.
Consider such a choice {U x‚äÇX} x‚ààX.
This is an open cover of X.
Now assume that Œ≥^| [0,t j] has been found.
By induction over j, this yields the required lift Œ≥^.
Therefore also the total lift is unique.
Alternatively, uniqueness of the lifts is a special case of lemma .
We just need to see that this lift is a continuous function.
This is the required lift.
Hence prop. says that covering projections are in particular Hurewicz fibrations.
With this the statement follows from .
Proof The implication 1)‚áí2) is immediate.
We need to show that the second statement already implies the first.
If a lift exists, then its uniqueness is given by lemma .
Hence we need to exhibit a lift.
Therefore f^(y‚Ä≤)‚âîf‚àòŒ≥^(1) is a lift of f(y‚Ä≤).
This will prove the claim.
But Œ≥‚Ä≤‚ãÖ(Œ≥¬Ø‚Ä≤‚ãÖŒ≥) is homotopic (via reparameterization) to just Œ≥.
This shows that the above prescription for f^ is well defined.
It only remains to show that the function f^ obtained this way is continuous.
Let y‚Ä≤‚ààY be a point and W f^(y‚Ä≤)‚äÇE an open neighbourhood of its image in E.
Let U f(y‚Ä≤)‚äÇX be an open neighbourhood over which p trivializes.
This shows that the lifted function is continuous.
Finally that this continuous lift is unique is the statement of lemma .
The lifting theorem implies that there are ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù covering spaces:
This is called the monodromy of the covering space.
It is a measure for how the covering space fails to be globally trivial.
Let ùí¢ be a groupoid.
Of course, all of these variations may be combined.
This abstract definition works more generally for any set function f:G‚Üí|V|.
An affine linear combination is a linear combination whose coefficients sum to 1.
These are the operations in an affine space.

More abstractly, Grothendieck categories are precisely Ab-enriched Grothendieck toposes.
This follows from the Gabriel-Popescu theorem together with the theory of enriched sheaves.

But then by 2-out-of-6, we have f‚ààW as desired.

In contrast, a weak category is a category without such structure.

We have a forgetful functor Ob:StrCat‚ÜíSet and a pseudofunctor Wk:StrCat‚ÜíCat.
(That is, a natural transformation between strict functors is automatically strict.)
We now make the above schematic definition explicit in terms of various different foundational systems.
Thus, StrCat is equivalent to Cat (as a bicategory).
For instance, consider the discrete category on the set of real numbers.
But again, we still have Disc:Set‚ÜíCat and we can define strict categories.

Some authors do not require an integral domain to be commutative.
However, on the nLab we require our integral domains to be commutative.
It then follows that every integral domain is a reduced ring.
The above definition is sometimes called a ring without zero divisors.
The ring of fractions of a Heyting integral domain is a Heyting field.

Many of the important theorems of measure theory fail to hold in full generality.
(See below under Theorems for which theorems we're talking about.)
Let Œº be a positive measure on an abstract set X.
(This is a preorder on the measurable sets.)
Then Œº is localizable if the following conditions both apply:
Every œÉ-finite measure is localizable.
(This is Theorem 213N in Fremlin.
I don't know if it characterizes localizable measures.)
(That is, LocMeas is equivalent to MeasLoc, a sort of pun.)
That said, nobody has worked out a constructive development of this yet.
There are counterexamples both to existence and uniqueness without these conditions.

Any cocomplete and epi-cocomplete category with a generator is total.

By a similar construction, the category of commutative rings is not cototal.
Then one argues that ‚àè Œ±hom(A Œ±,‚àí):CRing‚ÜíSet is continuous but not representable.
If C is cototal and J is small, then C J is cototal.
Indeed, any Grothendieck topos is both cototal and total.

A poset is a set equipped with a partial order.
(See also at enriched poset).
In this way, posets form a category Pos. Intervals
A poset is locally finite if every closed bounded interval is finite.
A poset with a top element and bottom element is called bounded.
A poset with a bounding countable subset is called œÉ-bounded.
(The poset is œÉ-bounded below if we have x m‚â§y instead.)
Note that every bounded poset is œÉ-bounded, but not conversely.
In higher category theory A poset can be understood as a (0,1)-category.
For non-finite sets this still holds with the axiom of choice.
This is called the Alexandroff topology on P.
Proposition This construction naturally extends to a full and faithful functor.

Compact rings are profinite
For R a compact ring, the canonical map œÄ:R‚ÜíR^ is injective.

Now the differential corresponds to a sequence of n-ary brackets.
One can consider two notions of morphisms: strict ones and general ones.
In the dual formulation this is due to Lada and Stasheff.
We may also think of this as a morphism of NQ-supermanifolds.
But we can turn it into a category of fibrant objects.
See Kan complex for more‚Ä¶
We now look at the axioms for our category of fibrant objects.
Let C be a category.
The axioms used here are the following.
the pullback of an acyclic fibrations is an acyclic fibration.
C has all products and in particular a terminal object *.
Write ùïÉ for the category of filtered L-infinity algebras
The differential dx=[x] 1 has the property namely?
It is a fibration if gr(f 1) is surjective.
Given C be a Getzler-category of fibrant objects.
So M kX ‚Ä¢ comes with a map X k‚ÜíM kX ‚Ä¢.
We assume that this is a fibration.
This allows us to define M k+1X ‚Ä¢ and to continue the induction.
So this defines a Reedy fibrant object .
The weak equivalences in sC are taken to be the levelwise weak equivalences.
If C is the category of Kan complexes, then P kX=sSet(Œî[k],X).
All the above is designed to make the following come out right.
Generally, C(*,X) is the set of points (global elements) of X.
For the category of Kan complexes, it is the identity functor.
For filtered L ‚àû-algebras it gives L‚Ü¶MC ‚Ä¢(L)=MC(L‚äóŒ© ‚Ä¢(Œî ‚Ä¢))

Now assume that we have a sheaf L-‚àû algebras over a topological space X.
Let {U Œ±‚ÜíX} be an open cover of X.
It is easy to prove it for abelian L ‚àû-algebras.
This would make the construction even smaller.

Distributive lattices and lattice homomorphisms form a concrete category DistLat.
(This may safely be left as an exercise.)
This convenience does not extend to infinitary distributivity, however.
Here is one such characterization:
Again this may be left as a (somewhat mechanical) exercise.
Both N 5 and M 3 are self-dual.
Birkhoff‚Äôs characterization is the following (manifestly self-dual) criterion.
This result gives another self-dual axiomatization of distributive lattices.
‚ÄúIf‚Äù: this is harder.
Assuming the cancellation law for L, we first show L is modular.
Now we show L is distributive.
From Proposition , it is not very hard to deduce Birkhoff‚Äôs theorem.
Any Boolean algebra, and even any Heyting algebra, is a distributive lattice.
Every frame and every œÉ -frame is a distributive lattice.
Any linear order is a distributive lattice.
The lattice of Young diagrams ordered by inclusion is distributive.
The opposite category of FinDistLat is equivalent to FinPoset: FinDistLat op‚âÉFinPoset.
Birkhoff duality does not hold for infinite distributive lattices.
This is an instance of a general phenomena known as Stone-type duality.
Then form the distributive lattice of finitely generated downsets in that.

The reflector is called canonical extension.
The concept arises in the context of duality.
Dual adjunctions between concrete categories are frequently represented by dualizing objects.

One possible choice is Q proj(*)=N(‚àí/C) op.

A nice discussion of this is in Gambino (2010).
See Street & Day (1997)
Similarly, monoidal enriched categories are pseudomonoids in VCat.
Eventually these should probably have their own pages.
This is proven in Schaeppi, Appendix A.
This extra structure supplies more control over constructions in the model category.
It is not clear whether or not this is true for any accessible model category.
There is also a canonical distributive law RQ‚ÜíQR comparing the two canonical bifibrant replacement functors.
There is a canonical comparison homomorphisms R{x 1,‚ãØ,x n}‚ü∂R[x 1,‚ãØ,x n].
This is typically denoted R{x 1,‚Ä¶,x n}.

The following are equivalent: T is model complete.
Every model of T is existentially closed.
Every existential formula is equivalent (mod T) to a universal formula.
Every formula is equivalent (mod T) to a universal formula.
The proposition below shows that the converse holds with some additional assumptions.
Model completeness + amalgamation property implies substructure completeness
Then T is substructure complete.
Let A be a substructure of some model M‚äßT.
Append the quantifier-free diagram of A to T to form T Diag(A).
Let Z amalgamate X and Y over A.
This theory therefore has no models.
In the Preliminaries we first introduce this sequence itself.
This should help to amplify how utterly elementary the salamander lemma is.
These morphisms are to be called the intramural maps of A.
We discuss the case that ‚àÇ=‚àÇ hor is a horizontal differential.
This is discussed in the Implications below.
These give the salamander lemma, prop. below, its name.
Hence the total map is given on representative by ‚àÇ hor.
We spell out the proof of the first case.
Also it clearly hits at most this kernel.
Suppose [a]‚ààA ‚ñ° is in the kernel of A ‚ñ°‚Üí ‚ñ°B.
This is discussed below in The basic diagram chasing lemmas.
This appears as (Bergman, cor. 2.1).
It is straightforward to check this directly on elements:
We discuss the horizontal case.
But this means that a‚ààim(‚àÇ hor)+im(‚àÇ vert) and hence [a]=0 in A ‚ñ°.
Conversely, consider [b]‚àà ‚ñ°B.
This means that ‚àÇ vertb=0 and ‚àÇ horb=0.
By B hor=0 the second condition means that there is a such that b=‚àÇ hora.
Moreover, this a satisfies ‚àÇ vert‚àÇ hora=‚àÇ vertb=0 by the first condition.
This appears as (Bergman, cor. 2.2).
We spell out the proof of the first item.
We derive the sharp 3x3 lemma from the salamander lemma.
The following proof is that given in (Bergman, lemma 2.3).
We need to show that A‚Ä≤ hor‚âÉ0 and B‚Ä≤ hor‚âÉ0.

In particular we have the following sharp 3x3 lemma.
Exactness in A‚Ä≤ and B‚Ä≤ is as in prop. .
For exactness in C‚Ä≤ we now use the long zigzag of intramural isomorphisms, cor .

What is a model in homotopy theory?
Another presentation may have a set of 0-simplices of different cardinality, say.
Why do we need models in homotopy theory?
The short answer is: we do not know how to work without models.
What is an ‚àû-category or (‚àû,1)-category?
An (‚àû,1)-category is a category enriched in (homotopy) spaces.
This can be formalized in many different ways.
Are quasicategories model-independent?
See homotopy type theory FAQ for a detailed explanation.
Here we only offer a highly impressionistic description.
In particular, first-order logic is subsumed into type theory.
This setup allows us to talk about homotopy types directly, without using models.
What is homotopical algebra?
It is often hard to separate homotopical algebra from homotopy theory.
How are model categories related to other models of ‚àû-categories?
In this case, the underlying (‚àû,1)-category admits finite ‚àû-(co)limits.
In this case, the underlying (‚àû,1)-category admits small ‚àû-(co)limits.
Finally, Hovey‚Äôs definition additionally requires factorizations to be functorial.
This condition does not seem to alter the class of underlying (‚àû,1)-categories.
What is the relationship between (higher) category theory and homotopy theory?
Homotopy theory also somewhat implicitly permeates classical category theory.
What is a derived functor?
This indeed works perfectly well.
Other (older) definitions involve Kan extensions along localization functors to homotopy categories.
These definitions do not have such nice theoretical properties as the definition considered above.
For example, they tend to misbehave when we try to derive compositions of functors.
What is the homotopy category of an (‚àû,1)-category?
This informal description can be formalized in any model of (‚àû,1)-categories.
The above is not quite true.
Much work was put into rectifying this defect of triangulated categories.
What is a derived category?
These model structures provide a convenient conceptual framework for projective resolutions and injective resolutions.
Another treatment of derived (‚àû,1)-categories can be given using stable quasicategories.
See Chapter 1 in Lurie‚Äòs Higher Algebra.
Do we still need model categories?
Why do we need model categories?
Is the ‚àû-category of spectra ‚Äúconvenient‚Äù?
Do we still need models of spectra other than the ‚àû-category Sp?
Techniques from algebraic geometry may then be applied to study learning with such devices.
Historically, it has been understood that the neural networks are singuar statistical models in
Sumio Watanabe, Almost all learning machines are singular, Proc. IEEE Symp.
For other sorts of shapes, there can be multiple shapes of each dimension.
Similarly, n-fold categories give extra structure to cubical sets.
Sometimes, two definitions that use different kinds of shapes nevertheless capture equivalent notions.
There exist a global operator representing composition of partial functions
called a magic pyramid of supergravity theories (ABDHN 13).
The entries display the corresponding U-duality groups.

is called small if D is a small category.
A product or coproduct over a small diagram is a small product or small coproduct.
I retired from a readership in mathematics at Sussex University (UK) in 1999.
I got courage for this from seeing here the names of some old mathematical colleagues.
One misses the gossip, too!
This medium of mathematical converse was a pipedream for me for many years.
In particular the volume (or area, or length) is a pseudoform.
See also discussion under ‚ÄúTwisted and vector-valued forms‚Äù at differential form.
Similarly an untwisted form Œ± corresponds to a pseudoform 1 o‚àßŒ±.
See integration of differential forms.
Alternatively, both of these examples can be thought of as absolute differential forms.
By contrast the magnetic field strength B is an untwisted 2-form.
A slight variant of this localization process is called E-theory.
In all of the following, ‚ÄúC *-algebra‚Äù means separable C*-algebra.
This is called the Kasparov product.
See at E-theory for more on this.
The Kasparov product, def. , is associative.
Q preserves split short exact sequences.
This is due to (Higson 87, theorem 4.5).
The generalization to the equivariant case is due to (Thomsen 98).
See there for more and see the references below.

This makes it a Hilbert bimodule.
This is the main result of (DEKM 11, section 3).
For A‚ààBoot‚Ü™KK one has that KK(A,B) satisfies a K√ºnneth theorem.
See at bootstrap category for more.
It is not expected that excision is satisfied fully generally by KK.
Instead, the universal improvement of KK-theory under excision can be constructed.
This is called E-theory.
For more discussion see at Poincar√© duality algebra.
The Baum-Connes conjecture is naturally formulated within KK-theory.
The Novikov conjecture has been verified in many cases using KK-theory.
(see for instance Rosenberg 80).

Suppose Œª is an n-box Young diagram.
Now, it is easy to see that the product of commuting idempotents is idempotent.
Such an identification is called a Young tableau.
This formula defines the Schur functor not only on objects but also on morphisms.
These more general functors are still called ‚ÄòSchur functors‚Äô.
This way of constructing Schur functors is known as plethysm.
There is a category Schur with Schur functors S R:FinDimVect‚ÜíFinDimVect as objects.
What is the relation between Schur functors and this groupoid.
In other words, it is a functor R:‚Ñô‚ÜíVect
As a result, any Schur functor gives a functor R:core(FinSet)‚ÜíVect
We call this the category of polynomial species.
The category of representations of any groupoid has many nice features.
Since ‚äó distributes over ‚äï, these make Schur into a rig category.
Aguiar and Mahajan call ‚äó the Hadamard product (see section 8.1.2).
Since √ó distributes over +, these make ‚Ñô into a rig category.
The same is true for the subcategory Schur.
Aguiar and Mahajan call this monoidal structure the Cauchy product.
Specifically, the Hadamard and Cauchy products form duoidal structures in both orders.
This gives Schur a fifth monoidal structure: the plethystic tensor product.
Unlike the four previous monoidal structures, this one is not symmetric.
The various structures that Schur possesses endow this ring with corresponding structures.
Among other things, it is the free lambda-ring on one generator.
We have described Schur functors as special functors F:FinDimVect‚ÜíFinDimVect
Our strategy is as follows.
We fix a symmetric monoidal Cauchy complete linear category, C.
Splitting these idempotents, we obtain the Schur functors S Œª:C‚ÜíC.
In summary, we have the following proposition.
Clearly these elements are idempotent: p Œª 2=p Œª.
We are particularly interested in the case G=S n.
In this case, we call the idempotents p Œª are ‚ÄòYoung symmetrizers‚Äô.
However, we will not need the formula for these idempotents.
The key step is to apply base change to k[S n].
As an object of C, we have (1)k[S n]‚âÖ‚®Å œÉ‚ààS nI
Schur functors are ‚Äúnatural‚Äù
Suppose now that we have a symmetric monoidal linear functor G:C‚ÜíD.
Let us put the question another way.
Now pseudonaturality is a very general phenomenon in 2-category theory.
The perhaps surprising answer is: no extra properties!
Let us now make this precise.
For the reader unaccustomed to these 2-categorical concepts, we recall:
With notation as above, let œï,œà:U‚ÜíV be two pseudonatural transformations.
A morphism of Schur functors is a modification between such pseudonatural transformations.
What this proposed definition makes manifestly obvious is that Schur functors are closed under composition.
There is a forgetful functor U:CommRing‚ÜíSet.
What are the natural transformations from this functor to itself?
And the reason is that ‚Ñ§[x] is the free commutative ring on one generator!
So, we say F(1) represents the functor U.
I added explanatory remarks above.
In other words, it sends symmetric monoidal categories to symmetric monoidal linear categories.
Finally, let LinCauch denote the 2-category of small Cauchy complete linear categories.
Even better, it is lax 2-symmetric monoidal.
So, it sends symmetric pseudomonoids to symmetric pseudomonoids.
However, it could still use more improvement.
Could you polish it up a bit, Todd?
Todd had written S n where I have put k[S n] here.
NB: This theorem refers only to the underlying category U(k‚Ñô¬Ø).
Now we consider composition of Schur functors U‚ÜíU, or equivalently symmetric monoidal linear functors k‚Ñô¬Ø‚Üík‚Ñô¬Ø.
We proceed to analyze this monoidal structure.
It may be easier to do this in reverse.
Any Schur functor may regarded as a functor 1‚ÜíFk‚Ñô¬Ø.
The only question is whether this functor is valued in k‚Ñô¬Ø.)
This is morally correct because it is indeed an appropriate categorification of polynomial composition.
The unit for this product is polynomial species X given by the representable ‚Ñô(‚àí,1):‚Ñô op‚ÜíFinDimVect.
By the equivalence, we have a unit isomorphism X‚ä†F‚âÖF.
Thus, corresponding to the identity on F‚ä†G we obtain an associativity map Œ±:(‚àí‚ä†F)‚ä†G‚Üí‚àí‚ä†(F‚ä†G).
The equivalence Schur‚ÜíSymMonLinCauch(k‚Ñô¬Ø,k‚Ñô¬Ø) takes a polynomial species F to ‚àí‚ä†F.
The category of modules over a bimonoid is a monoidal category.
Now we consider a particular case of tensor product representations.

Classically, ‚ÄúGalois extension‚Äù refers to a class of extensions of fields.
An extension K‚äÇL of fields is Galois if it is normal and separable.
There is a famous Galois theory for such extensions.
Suppose that the sequence f converges uniformly to a function f ‚àû.
Then f ‚àû is also continuous.
Then f ‚àû is also continuous.
The first counterexamples to Non-Theorem arose as Fourier series.
The sawtooth wave ‚àë k=1 ‚àûsin(kx)k=œÄ2‚àíxmod2œÄ2 may be the simplest.
And indeed, the sum is not continuous at multiples of 2œÄ.
Again, the sequence is not equicontinuous, and its convergence is not uniform.
Another counterexample is f n(x)‚âîexp(‚àín|x|).
Here is Cauchy's argument: Proof?
Let œµ be a positive number, and consider œµ/3.
Fixing any such n, f ‚àû is continuous.
Let œµ be a positive number, and consider œµ/3.
Fixing any such n,n‚Ä≤,n‚Ä≥, f ‚àû is continuous.
This can be fixed up to a point.
Indeed, Non-theorem is false, as the counterexamples show.
Let œµ be a positive number, and consider œµ/3.
Fixing any such n, f ‚àû is continuous.
Let œµ be a positive number, and consider œµ/3.
Fixing any such n, f ‚àû is continuous.
Fixing any such n, f ‚àû is continuous.
Indeed, consider the counterexample f n(x)=exp(‚àín|x|) near x=1.
In between, when nh is finite and finitesimal, both fail!
Fixing any such n, f ‚àû is continuous.
Fixing any such n, f ‚àû is continuous.
Fixing any such n, f ‚àû is continuous.
One interpretation of this is that it fails to converge at some nonstandard points.
used Cauchy's sum theorem to motivate the concept of uniform convergence.
The original sum theorem is in Augustin Cauchy (1821).
Lakatos's discussion forms Chapter 3 of Imre Lakatos? (1978).
One says equivalently that categories with finite products are cosifted categories.
Let ùíû be a small category which has finite products.
Now observe that the colimit of a representable presheaf is the singleton.
Historically, this amplitude first arose in dual resonanace models?
Still, it is common to work with compact subsets of a given space.
These are those subsets which are compact spaces with the subspace topology.
There are many ways to say that a space X is compact.
This is called a finite open cover if I is a (Kuratowski-)finite set.
The various reformulations of compactness fall into several families.
Then also the total intersection is inhabited, ‚à©i‚ààIC i‚â†‚àÖ.
The closed-subset formulations of compactness appear frequently and are often more convenient.
Here is an equivalent way to phrase it that is often convenient for locale theory.
This ùí∞‚Ä≤ is clearly directed, and an open cover of X since ùí∞ is.
This is equivalent to the characterization given in the Idea-section above:
See also closed morphism.)
This leads us to the following proposition.
Thus, compactness of X is equivalent to !:X‚Üí1 being stably closed.
For a proof, see closed-projection characterization of compactness.
See also the page compactness and stable closure (under construction).
A dual condition is satisfied by an overt space.
Hence the intersection of the closed compact subspaces is closed.
Let X be a topological space.
Let K‚äÇX be a compact subspace; U‚äÇX be an open subset.
Then the complement K‚àñU‚äÇXcov is itself a compact subspace.
Let {V i‚äÇK‚àñU} be an open cover of the complement subspace.
We need to show that this admits a finite subcover.
Assuming the axiom of choice, the category of compact spaces admits all small products.
However, the category of compact spaces does not admit equalizers.
Proposition We have: compact subspaces of Hausdorff spaces are closed.
closed subsets of compact spaces are compact
Hence: closed subspaces of compact Hausdorff spaces are equivalently compact subspaces
Proposition continuous images of compact spaces are compact
Proposition maps from compact spaces to Hausdorff spaces are closed and proper
Proposition continuous metric space valued function on compact metric space is uniformly continuous
See at compact object ‚Äì Compact objects in Top Examples
(closed intervals are compact)
Any set when equipped with the cofinite topology forms a compact space.
This space is compact by the Tychonoff theorem.
But it is not sequentially compact.
(We essentially follow Steen-Seebach 70, item 105).
Hence (a n k) is not convergent.
(Basically that‚Äôs the diagonal trick of Cantor's theorem).
This includes the expected examples in various gros toposes.
Thus, properness is a ‚Äúrelativized‚Äù version of compactness.
For general references see the list at topology.
Examples of compact spaces that are not sequentially compact are in
L is a transitive big class containing all the ordinals.
The sets in this class can be effectively enumerated by von Neumann ordinals.
And even the generalized continuum hypothesis holds for L as a model.
Given the independence, one may add L=V as an axiom.

Then (S,‚ä§,‚à©,‚ä≤,‚ãÑ) is a formal topology.

Then (S,‚ä§,‚à©,‚ä≤,‚ãÑ) is a formal topology.
Then (S,‚ä§,‚à©,‚ä≤,‚ãÑ) is a formal topology.
Then we get a formal topology, defining ‚ãÑ in the unique way.
This is the original development, intended as an application of locale theory to logic.

This has newer results, alternative formulations, etc.
The existence of a maximal element is often given by Zorn's lemma.
Let P be a preordered set and x an element of P.
Suppose that P is totally ordered.
Then a maximal element of P is the same as a top element of P.
Suppose that P is finite and has a unique maximal element x.
Then x is a top element of P.
Then a is the unique maximal element of P but still not a top.

We identify Top CW‚Ü™Top CW ‚Ü™ by X‚Ü¶(X,‚àÖ).
In one direction, suppose that E ‚Ä¢ satisfies the original excision axiom.
Hence the excision axiom implies E ‚Ä¢(X,B)‚ü∂‚âÉE ‚Ä¢(A,A‚à©B).
Conversely, suppose E ‚Ä¢ satisfies the alternative condition.
Let E ‚Ä¢ be an cohomology theory, def. , and let A‚Ü™X.
Consider U‚âî(Cone(A)‚àíA√ó{0})‚Ü™Cone(A), the cone on A minus the base A.
Define a reduced cohomology theory, def. (EÀú ‚Ä¢,œÉ) as follows.
This is clearly functorial.
The construction in def. indeed gives a reduced cohomology theory.
By lemma we have an isomorphism EÀú ‚Ä¢(X‚à™Cone(A))=E ‚Ä¢(X‚à™Cone(A),{*})‚ü∂‚âÉE ‚Ä¢(X,A).
Hence the left vertical sequence is exact.
Let (EÀú ‚Ä¢,œÉ) be a reduced cohomology theory, def. .
The construction in def. indeed yields an unreduced cohomology theory.
For excision, it is sufficient to consider the alternative formulation of lemma .
For CW-inclusions, this follows immediately with lemma .
With this the natural isomorphism is given by lemma .
As before, this is isomorphic to the unreduced mapping cone of the point inclusion.
Finally we record the following basic relation between reduced and unreduced cohomology:
Hence this is a split exact sequence and the statement follows.
The generalized cohomology theories considered above assign cohomology groups.
Let (E,Œº,1) be a multiplicative cohomology theory, def. .
This is a spectrum or more specifically: a sequential spectrum .

And of course they are compact objects.

To that end consider the following lemma.
It remains to confirm that this indeed gives the desired bijection.
This concludes the proof of Lemma (‚ãÜ).
But then prop. implies that X‚Ä≤‚ü∂Z is in fact an equivalence.
Hence the component map Y‚ÜíZ‚âÉZ is a lift of Œ∫ through Œ∏.
The first condition on a Brown functor holds by definition of H ‚Ä¢.
This means that the four lemma applies to this diagram.
Inspection shows that this implies the claim.
With this, the second clause follows by the Yoneda lemma.
The category Ab (‚Ñï,‚â•) of towers of abelian groups has enough injectives.
We need to show that lim‚üµ 1A ‚Ä¢‚âÉker(lim‚üµ(j 2))/im(lim‚üµ(j 1)).
Now observe that each injective J ‚Ä¢ q is a tower of epimorphism.

This shows that Œæ is a group homomorphism.
The ring homomorphsim in lemma is an isomorphism.
See for instance (Kochmann 96, theorem 1.5.10).
This is the Thom isomorphism.

We will show that this is the Euler class in question.
Concatenating these with the above exact sequences yields the desired long exact sequence.

The fundamental distinction is between open and closed mechanical systems.
Closed systems are conservative in energetic sense.
We set up some basic notions of classical mechanics.
This definition readily generalized to symmetric monoidal categories.
Write Poiss for the resulting category of (super) Poisson algebras.
The standard setup of conservative classical mechanical system is a Poisson manifold.
Recall that every symplectic manifold provides an example of a Poisson manifold.
Possibly infinite-dimensional generalization of this example is called a phase space.
Poisson superalgebras describe systems with fermions.
Systems without fermions may be described by plain Poisson algebras.
This definition captures most notions of ‚Äúmechanical systems‚Äù.

Perturbative string theory is defined in terms of certain classes of 2d CFTs.
Depending on which class that is, one speaks of different types of string theory.
This gives rise to various further anomaly cancellation conditions:
More generally, any object with this property is called a zero object.
Categorifying horizontally instead, we get the notion of zero morphism.
All these ideas can be, and have been, categorified further.
One may use this idea as a definition of the general concept of real number.
Thus, we can construct ‚Ñù immediately as a subquotient of the function set ‚Ñö ‚Ñï.
We do this by requiring explicit moduli of convergence.
Some variations are often met.
It is also possible to fix a specific modulus Œ± ahead of time.
One way is to use multivalued functions from the natural numbers.
Another way is to use nets (also called ‚Äògeneralised sequences‚Äô).
Classically, all of these definitions are equivalent.
Without WCC, the classical Cauchy real numbers are not very well behaved.
A modulated Cauchy sequence of modulated Cauchy sequences does converge to a modulated Cauchy sequence.
Thus, we cannot prove that every classical Cauchy sequence is modulated.
This is stronger than merely being a modulated Cauchy real number.
Thus, this procedure may be generalised to any metric space to produce its completion.
We might instead want to approximate x by arbitrarily long decimal fractions.
Note we may be rounding up or down, regardless of which is nearer.
Choice is needed only to make infinitely many approximations at once.
Trying to avoid this can motivate multivalued Cauchy real numbers.
See also the references at real number and constructive analysis.

A manifold equipped with a framing is also called a parallelized manifold.

This satisfies S‚àßSÀú=‚ä• but not S‚à®SÀú=‚ä§ in general.
This case includes the complement of a subset even in constructive mathematics.

Cocycled crossed product There is also a more general cocycled crossed product.
We do not assume that ‚ñπ is an action.
Therefore it is an example of a nonabelian cocycle in Hopf algebra theory.
The cocycled crossed product is an associative algebra iff œÉ is a cocycle.
If so, we call U‚ôØ œÉH cocycled crossed product algebra.
The cocycled crossed product then reduces to the usual smash product algebra.

1. If the induced morphism ker(e)‚Üíker(ne) is ff, then n is faithful.
1. If ker(e)‚Üíker(ne) is an equivalence, then n is ff.
By the hypothesis, nŒ≤ 1r=nŒ≤ 2r implies Œ≤ 1r=Œ≤ 2r.
Thus, n is faithful.
Then g, being a pullback of e√óe, is eso.
By assumption, (e/e)‚Üí(ne/ne) is an equivalence.
But this says precisely that n is ff.
First suppose K is regular; we must show the last two conditions.
Let f:A‚ÜíB be any morphism.

To get this, take this to be the pullback diagram, w‚Ä≤:=h *w.

To get this, take w‚Ä≤ to be the equalizer of the two morphisms.
So w‚Ä≤ is in W.
We need to show that a is W-local.

The realization of a product of two representables Œî(‚àí,m)√óŒî(‚àí,n) is compact.
It suffices to observe that Œî[m]√óŒî[n] has finitely many non-degenerate simplices.
But a continuous bijection from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is a homeomorphism.
The functor R:Set Œî op‚ÜíSpace preserves products.

In particular, elliptic cohomology theories give elliptic curves over A 0(‚Ä¢).

The last statement implies that R contains the rational numbers as a subring.
The regularity conditions are trivial.
Let A be an oriented complex oriented cohomology theory.
Now apply cohomology functor to the sequence X‚Üí‚ÑÇP ‚àû√ó‚ÑÇP ‚àû‚Üí‚ÑÇP ‚àû.
We have a degree 0 element t in the cohomology of ‚ÑÇP ‚àû.
Its image in the cohomology of ‚ÑÇP ‚àû√ó‚ÑÇP ‚àû is a formal group law.
(The constant term of~œï is zero.)
Hence formal group laws form a category.
If R contains rational numbers as a subring, then we have two canonical homomorphisms.
This shows up in cohomology as Chern character.
A formal group is a group in the category of formal schemes.
A formal scheme Y^ is defined for any closed immersion of schemes Y‚Ü™X.

This should be distinguished from barring the trivial object entirely.
Perhaps the basic example is that False is not true.

(This is linked with his work on pro-representable functors.)
A finite index subgroup of a profinite group is not necessarily open.
Here is a standard way to obtain examples of such.
Since no proper open subset of ‚àè ‚ÑïG is dense, K is not open.

This builds on the companion paper Dan Dugger, Universal homotopy theories
T. R. Govindarajan is a theoretical physicist at Chennai (Madras), India.
This page goes through some basics of √©tale cohomology.
This is called the √©tale site X et of the scheme.
The category of sheaves on that site is called the √©tale topos of the scheme.
The next section then genuinely considers the corresponding abelian sheaf cohomology.
But √©tale cohomology has a more fundamental raison d‚Äô√™tre than this.
The second essentially just says demands this has finite fibers.
The definition of formally √©tale in components goes like this.
It is useful to realize this equivalently but a bit more naturally as follows.
The adjoint triple to be shown is obtained from composing these adjoints pairwise.
This is what we do implicitly in the following.
Every etale morphism is a flat morphism.
Flat morphism between affines Spec(B)‚ÜíSpec(A) is faithfully flat precisely if it is surjective
We repeatedly use the following example of √©tale morphisms.
Then the following descent theorem effectively solves the descent problem over these remaining covers.
Suppose given an arbitrary √©tale covering {X‚Ä≤ i‚ÜíX‚Ä≤} over X.
By pullback stability, prop. , these are still √©tale maps.
The latter is by open immersions.
Now this is morphism is etale, hence flat, but also surjective.
That makes it a faithfully flat morphism.
Therefore we are led to consider descent along faithfully flat morphisms of affines.
For these the descent theorem says that they are effective epimorphisms:
This is due to (Grothendieck, FGA1).
For the first this is clear (it is Zariski topology-descent).
See also for instance (Tamme I 1.4).
This may serve to give a first idea of the nature of √©tale cohomology.
We consider now the √©tale abelian sheaf cohomology with coefficients in such coherent modules.

A Hopf algebroid is an associative bialgebroid with an antipode.
Specifically commutative Hopf algebroids are the internal groupoids in the opposite category of CRing.
These arise notably in stable homotopy theory as generalized dual Steenrod algebras for generalized cohomology.
In the general case we should distinguish left and right bialgebroids, see bialgebroid.
In fact this is an antiequivalence of categories.
There are several generalizations to the noncommutative case.
To add an antipode is nontrivial.
Gabi later showed that the two definitions are in fact equivalent.
Let A be a unital associative algebra.
Thus she calls this example a coarse Hopf algebroid.
This is a noncommutative generalization (of formal dual of) an action groupoid.
So, they define a bialgebroid to be a comonoid in VCat.
With this definition, a Hopf algebra gives a one-object Hopf algebroid.
For a symmetric version see M. Stojiƒá, Scalar extension Hopf algebroids, arXiv:2208.11696
For n‚àà‚Ñï +, consider complex projective n-space ‚ÑÇP n.
For Œ£ a compact connected Riemann surface write g Œ£‚àà‚Ñï for its genus.
An analogous result for real projective spaces is in Adamaszek, Kozlowski & Yamaguchi 2008.
Therefore one speaks of a false vacuum in this case.
The classical articles are
The above definition corresponds to the special case of the 2-category Cat.
Explicating this condition in elementary terms, one arrives at the above definition.
A simpler version of this characterization is the following.
Let œÄ:B/p‚ÜíB denote the projection (x,e,k)‚Ü¶x.
In turn, this means that p is a cloven fibration.
For these reasons, Street fibrations in Cat are little-studied.
However, when internalizing in other 2-categories, covariance becomes more important.
Some of the applications are internal to 2-categories other than Cat.
Street fibrations in Cat also arise in mathematics, though often under different names.

The analogous statement then holds for the rational numbers ‚Ñö‚äÇ‚Ñù equipped with their subspace topology.
Let X be a derived prestack.
Before diving into the various variants of cotangent complexes, we summarize their relationships here.
In algebraic geometry, relative notions are notions about families.
Relative cotangent complexes encode deformation theory of families.
Of course these are analogous to relative cotangent bundles in differential geometry.
Hence the notion is truly ubiquitous in deformation theory.
Both the local and global notions above can be relativized‚Ä¶
Some elaboration of these ideas are found in the article cotangent complex.
We discuss ‚àû-Lie algebroids in the cohesive (‚àû,1)-topos H th:=SynthDiff‚àûGrpd of synthetic differential ‚àû-groupoids.
We write bùî§ for L ‚àû-algebroids over the point.
They form the full subcategory L ‚àûAlg‚Ü™L ‚àûAlgd.
We now construct an embedding of L ‚àûAlgs into SynthDiff‚àûGrpd.
We shall refine the image of Œû to cosimplicial smooth algebras.
Write SmoothAlg:=TAlg for its category of algebras: these are the smooth algebras.
See the examples at smooth algebra for more details on this kind of argument.
The last equivalence holds as discussed there and at models for ‚àû-stack (‚àû,1)-toposes.
We may abstractly formalize this in an (infinity,1)-topos H with differential cohesion as follows.
This is discussed in detail at L-‚àû algebra and Lie algebroid.
Therefore the claim for Œì follows analogously.
We have an equivalence Œ† inf(ùîû)‚âÉŒ† inf(X).
Let first X=U‚ààCartSp synthdiff be a representable.
For more on this see ‚àû-Lie algebroid cohomology.
By this discussion at SynthDiff‚àûGrpd we have that H n(ùîû,‚Ñù)‚âÉH nN ‚Ä¢(ùïÉùí™)(i(ùîû)).
By the Dold-Kan correspondence we have hence ‚ãØ‚âÉH n(CE(ùîû)).
(These smooth loci have been considered in (Kock, section 1.2)).
In this expression the roles of the two sets of indices is manifestly symmetric.
But this is indeed the case.
We discuss this from the perspective of infinitesimal groupoids.
Let G be a Lie group with Lie algebra ùî§.
We describe how ùî§ looks when regarded as a special case of an ‚àû-Lie algebroid.
If these equivalent conditions hold, we write Œª‚ä¥Œº.
For any uncountable regular cardinal Œª we have ‚Ñµ 0‚ä≤Œª.
For any regular cardinal Œª we have Œª‚ä≤Œª + (its successor cardinal).
We write Œª‚â™Œº if for every Œª‚Ä≤<Œª and Œº‚Ä≤<Œº we have (Œº‚Ä≤) Œª‚Ä≤<Œº.
(This is Higher Topos Theory, Definition A.2.6.3.)
The converse claim (Œª‚ä≤Œº implies Œª‚â™Œº) is independent of ZFC.
If Œ∫ is an inaccessible cardinal, then every Œª<Œ∫ satisfies Œª‚ä≤Œ∫.
‚Ñµ 1‚ä≤‚Ñµ œâ+1 does not hold.
A typical example is the phenomenon of plethysm.

Sometimes another symbol is used for Kleene equality, such as s‚âÉt.
The example (2) can be fixed in either of two ways.
This states that (2) holds whenever x‚â†0, which is correct.
Then Kleene equality denotes equality of these operations.
Atomic sites are sites (ùíû,J at) equipped with the atomic topology J at.
The corresponding sheaf toposes Sh(ùíû,J at) are precisely the atomic Grothendieck toposes.
A Grothendieck topology J at of this form is called atomic.
That J at is indeed a Grothendieck topology is ensured by prop. .
Let ùíû be a category.
The condition occurring in the proposition is called the (right) Ore condition.
The atomic topology is a special case of this:
Then the atomic topology J at coincides with the dense topology J d.
For ùíû=‚àÖ the claim is trivial.
So let C‚ààùíû be an object and S a sieve on C.
Conversely, assume S‚ààJ at(C) and let f:D‚ÜíC be a morphism.
For the proof see Mac Lane-Moerdijk (1994, pp.126f).
A site of the form (ùíû,J at) is called atomic.
Then Sh(ùíû,J at) is an atomic Grothendieck topos.
For the details see Caramello (2012, prop.1.4).
Accordingly the subcategory ùíû‚Ä≤ is empty and Sh(ùíû,J at)‚âÉ1 is degenerate.
In particular, Sh(ùíû,J at) is not equivalent to Sh(ùíû,J d)‚âÉSh ¬¨¬¨(Set ùíû op)‚âÉSet√óSet.
So we see that the atomic topology on ùíû is distinct from the dense topology.
In fact more can be said here:
The set of all representative functions on G is a Hopf F-algebra.
Let X be an abstract set.
Let G be a collection of such distance functions.
Consider the following potential properties of G:
Reflexivity: For every d‚ààG and x‚ààX, we have d(x,x)=0.
The corresponding bottom element is the zero function 0: 0(x,y)‚âî0.
Then the same 6 axioms may be expressed as follows:
(In light of Isotony, we may require d=0.)
(In light of Isotony, we may require f=d‚à®e.)
We sometimes wish to consider collections of distance functions that generate (quasi)-prometrics.
(See Subcategories below.)
(Again, this may be defined constructively as an infimum.)
The collection of such d U is a base for a prometric on X.
In this way every short map induces a uniformly continuous map as well.
The composition of strong epimorphisms is a strong epimorphism.
If f‚àòg is a strong epimorphism, then f is a strong epimorphism.
Every regular epimorphism is strong.
The converse is true if C is regular.
Every strong epimorphism is extremal.
The converse is true if C has pullbacks.
Therefore in an (‚àû,1)-topos strong epimorphisms again coincide with effective epimorphisms.
Strong epimorphisms were introduced in: Gregory Maxwell Kelly.
Grothendieck emphasized the study of schemes over a fixed base scheme.
Let k be some base field.
Next we visit the notion of √©tale group scheme.

Affine group varieties are called linear algebraic groups.

is the spectrum of a commutative Hopf algebra.
The functor Œº:=ùîæ m is a group scheme given by ùîæ m(S)=Œì(S,ùí™ S) √ó.
A scheme is sent to the invertible elements of its global functions.
This group scheme is called the multiplicative group scheme.
These kernels give the group schemes of the n-th root of unity.
Note that the multiplicative group scheme is diagonalizable.
Every diagonalizable group scheme is in particular of multiplicative type.
The additive group scheme assigns to a ring its additive group.
Also here the kernels of the powering-by-n map are of interest.
These kernels give the group schemes of the n-th nilpotent element?.
Group schemes can be constructed by restriction of scalars.
This group scheme is called the additive group scheme.
(is synonymous to local group scheme?)
Every algebraic group is in particular a group scheme.
Suppose now that G is a finite flat commutative group scheme (over X).
The Cartier dual of G is given by the functor G D(S)=Hom(G‚äóS,ùîæ m‚äóS).
The Hom is taken in the category of group schemes over S.
Since k is perfect Frobenius is an automorphism.
On the left we have the category of affine commutative unipotent group schemes.
An idempotent monoid in abelian groups (Ab,‚äó ‚Ñ§,‚Ñ§) is a solid ring.

A self-normalizing and nilpotent subalgebra ùî•‚â§ùî§ is called a Cartan subalgebra of ùî§.
By self-normalizing, we mean that Nor ùî§(ùî•)=ùî•.
Hence, ùî• is not an ideal in any larger subalgebra of ùî§.
Of von Neumann algebras Preduals are particularly studied for von Neumann algebras.

Toposes are extensive Toposes are extensive
Every elementary topos is a finitary extensive category.
In particular, a cocomplete elementary topos is infinitary extensive.
There are several possible proofs.
Thus, in this case it suffices to deal with finite coproducts.
Dually, j is monic.
But since r is an isomorphism, this factorization must be the left coprojection A‚ÜíA+X.
Finally, since 0 is a strict initial object, 0‚ÜíS is monic.
By the previous paragraph, f=g, hence S‚âÖ0 and is initial.
Finally, we give a proof that applies constructively to arbitrary coproducts.
it suffices for ‚àê J to be faithful.

We will also write this function as x k:‚Ñù n‚Üí‚Ñù.

The terminal object is ‚Ñù 0, the point.
This is called the theory of smooth algebras.
A product-preserving functor A:CartSp‚ÜíSet is a smooth algebra.
A homomorphism of smooth algebras is a natural transformation between the corresponding functors.
This is illustrated by the next example.
We discuss a standard structure of a site on the category CartSp.
This generates a genuine Grothendieck topology, but need not itself already be one.
Differentiably good covers are useful for computations.
Their full impact is however on the homotopy theory of simplicial presheaves over CartSp.
Despite its appearance, this is not quite a classical statement.
The good open covers do not yet form a Grothendieck topology on CartSp.
So this is a good open cover of ‚Ñù 2.
But it has an evident refinement by a good open cover.
This is a special case of what the following statement says in generality.
The differentially good open covers, def. , constitute a coverage on CartSp.
Hence CartSp equipped with that coverage is a site.
This is evidently an open cover, albeit not necessarily a good open cover.
By example this good open cover coverage is not a Grothendieck topology.
But as any coverage, it uniquely completes to one which has the same sheaves.
But the latter is (more) useful for several computational purposes in the following.
This is rough, needs further development.
We say that these symbols express the judgment that X is a type.
We will see more interesting such horizontal-line statements below.

Let M be a monoid object in C with unit e:1‚ÜíM and multiplication ‚ãÖ:M‚äóM‚ÜíM.
The same can be said about topological spaces and continuous actions of topological groups.
The algebras of the resulting action monad are the modules over that ring.
It is commutative if and only if M is commutative as a monoid.
(See for example Brandenburg, Example 6.3.12.)
The following explanation is taken from Perrone, Example 5.1.14.

We need to show that U 0 is open.
Consider any point x‚ààU 0.
Now assume that every connected component of every open subset U is open.
Finally assume that every open subspace is the disjoint union of its connected components.
Let x be a point and U x‚äÉ{x} a neighbourhood.
We need to show that U x contains a connected neighbourhood of x.
Every discrete topological space is locally connected.
(Euclidean space is locally connected)
This shows that ever open neighbourhood contains a connected neighbourhood.

More generally, for positive characteristic, the definition is more involved than that.
The abelian sheaf cohomology over Cris(X) is the crystalline cohomology of X.
Let k be a ring.
Let k‚ÜíR be a finitely presented k-algebra.
This result is due to (Hutzler 2018).
Let f:X‚ÜíS be a scheme over S.
Assume that X is locally of finite presentation over S.
StrCat has the same underlying category as the symmetric monoidal category Gray.
This embedding is very useful in the proofs of several fundamental theorems.
This definition has various equivalent reformulations which are often useful.
From this one obtains the following equivalent characterization:
This is the content of the following proposition.
Proposition ùî∏ ‚Ñö is a locally compact Hausdorff commutative ring.
In particular, it is complete with respect to its uniform space structure.
All of this generalizes to any number field k.
In this way the ring of adeles ùî∏ k is topologized.
This is the topology on the ideles.
For a global field Fully generally, let k be a global field.
This is topologized in the same way as discussed above.

In other categories The notion of magma makes sense in any monoidal category C.
So all of these have opposites.
We denote the first as A op and the second as A co.

An n-category has n kinds of opposites.
See (or write) opposite n-category?.
A monoidal n-category? has n+1 kinds of opposites.
Compactness is an extremely useful concept in topology.
This is more traditionally known as studying the topology using sequences and convergent sequences.
The answer to that question is ‚Äúsequential compactness‚Äù.
The following is a list of properties of and pertaining to sequentially compact spaces.
For a metric space, the notions of sequential compactness and compactness coincide.
See at sequentially compact metric spaces are equivalently compact metric spaces.
A countable product of sequentially compact spaces is again sequentially compact.
Let {X j} be a countable family of sequentially compact spaces.
We build a sequence of nested subsequences S j=x j(n) as follows.
Let V‚äÜX be such that V‚àâùíØ 2.
Thus y=v and so (x n k)‚Üív in ùíØ 1.
A metric space is sequentially compact precisely if it is compact.
See at sequentially compact metric spaces are equivalently compact metric spaces.
The long line is such an example.
See at compact space ‚Äì Compact spaces which are not sequentially compact.
Since Disc({0,1}) is a finite discrete topological space it is clearly compact.
Therefore the Tychonoff theorem says that also X is compact.
We will argue by contradiction.
(This refutation by contradiction, refuting sequential compactness, is constructively valid.

This page is about the notion of poly-morphism considered by Shinichi Mochizuki.
For the concept in computer science see polymorphism.
Or see universe polymorphism for the concept in type theory.
We say that the morphisms of C poly are the poly-morphisms of C.
Hence a poly-isomorphism is a collection of invertible morphisms of C.
Germany had for many years gone down a non-empiricist path.
We can‚Äôt see the world as it is in itself.
He read off twelve ‚Äúcategories‚Äù from the types of judgement we make.
Hegel criticises him for only listing the 12 categories.
The thing was to deduce them from first principles.
The world is secondary.
The Idea has an internal dynamic which is driven by the dialectical process.
It requires a world to play itself out in.
We are a vehicle for the Idea.
We and our experience are just one part of the working out of the Idea.

This entry is a chapter of geometry of physics.
We linearize this to an (infinity,1)-module bundle by composing with B 2U(1)‚ÜíBGL 1(KU).
The abstract picture behind this cohomological motivic quantization is discussed at dependent linear type theory.
Here we focus on explicit details for the case of KU-quantization.
A category is confluent if for any span B‚ÜêA‚ÜíC, there exists a cospan B‚ÜíD‚ÜêC.
Note that we do not require the resulting square to commute.
There are however different formalizations of this idea.
An important application of the above factorization property is accordingly named the small object argument.
See also Subtleties and different meanings below.
Let C be a locally small category that admits filtered colimits.
Proposition (smooth colimits of compact objects are compact)
See Adamek-Rosicky, Remark 1.30.
An alternative proof of this improvement is proposed at this mathoverflow question.
In C= Set an object is compact precisely if it is a finite set.
For C a topos, X is compact if: C is
A proof may be found in Ad√°mek-Rosick√Ω 94, Corollary 3.13.
A finite-dimensional vector space is compact in Vect, see here.
One has to be careful about the following variations of the theme of compactness.
In non-additive contexts, the above definition is not right.
In general one should expect to instead preserve filtered colimits, as above.
Recall the above example of compact topological spaces.
See also the blog discussion here.
This example is discussed on page 50 of Hovey‚Äôs book.
See this lemma at classical model structure on topological spaces.
If ‚Ñ∞ is a sheaf topos, this is called a concrete sheaf.
The dual notion is that of a co-concrete object.
Œì is a faithful functor on morphisms whose codomain is concrete.
This shows that concX‚âîim(Œ∑ X ‚ôØ) is indeed concrete.
It remains to show that this construction is left adjoint to the inclusion.
But this is equivalently the statement that the left morphism is an epimorphism.
Specifically for epistemic logic this is also known as possible worlds semantics.
There is also algebraic semantics in terms of algebras with (co)-closure operators.
For instance, temporal logics can have posets as models.
It gives a way of deciding if a formula is ‚Äòwell-formed‚Äô.
One of the basic axiom systems leads to normal modal logics.
Suppose given a normal modal logic, Œõ in ‚Ñí œâ(n).
Here is a brief list of flavors of modal logic.
More details are discussed below.
The metalogical version was important in the history of modern modal logic.
G√∂del played an important role there.
We discuss the semantics of modal logics, its models.
The geometric / relational /Kripke semantics of modal logics are instances of coalgebraic semantics.
Every category comes with its internal logic.
See at modal type theory for more on this.
Examples for this are local toposes and cohesive toposes.
See there for more details.
Yves Andr√© is a mathematician at √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure of Paris.
Composition of prefunctions is also possible, but likewise does not preserve equality.
(This extension is the ‚Äúrenormalization‚Äù of the time-ordered product).
This extension is not unique.
Every such choice corresponds to a choice of perturbative S-matrix for the theory.
This construction is called causal perturbation theory.
One can therefore consider composition of such representable covariant functors.
Ah, but I have not told you what P‚äôA is!
How do I do this?
That‚Äôs a complicated way of saying that V represents a covariant functor VAlg‚ÜíSet.
Precomposing this with the functor represented by P yields again a covariant functor VAlg‚ÜíSet.
This is again representable and we write its representing object P‚äôA.
As an aside, we note a consequence.
Now we‚Äôre seeing this monoidal category acts on the category of V-algebras.
We also have that A‚àêA=A‚äïA.
That means that for a‚ààA, Œº(a)=(a 1,a 2) for some a 1,a 2‚ààA.
Now, one of the laws says that œµ is a counit for Œº.
So, we have no choice here either.
What remains is to fit Œπ into the structure.
The first issue is that Œπ is not automatically a morphism in AbGrp.
In fact, it is an involution from the relations for abelian groups.
The final relation is that Œπ is the inverse for Œº.
Also, œµ=0 and Œ∑:I‚ÜíA is the initial morphism in AbGrp.
For details on this see The Hunting of the Hopf Ring, referred to below.
This monoidal structure for abelian groups turns out to be the tensor product.
We now recapitulate the discussion above in a slightly more general context.
The monad morphism T‚Üíhom(R,‚àí‚ãÖR) has components TX‚Üíhom(R,X‚ãÖR) for each set X.
Thus, for example, 2‚ãÖR is the ring R‚äóR.
The resultant monoidal product on T-bialgebras is denoted ‚äô.
Here œµUS is the same as the T-algebra structure TUS‚ÜíUS on S.
In this case the monad Œõ‚äô‚àí has right adjoint given by hom(Œõ,‚àí).
An old and long query-discussion has been archived starting here.
I am not sure that the terminology is optimal.
MacLane calls the correspondence conjugation (Categories for Working Mathematician, 99-102).
The inverse is similarly given by the composition S‚Ä≤‚ü∂S‚Ä≤Œ∑S‚Ä≤TS‚ü∂S‚Ä≤œàSS‚Ä≤T‚Ä≤S‚ü∂œµ‚Ä≤SS
This pair of a monad and a comonad are adjoint.
This is essentially the consequence of Lemma.
This one follows by one of the triangle identities for the adjunction T l‚ä£G l.
An adjoint modality is an example of a pair of adjoint monads.
So we say instead a monad adjoint to a comonad.
Distinguish from the adjoint triple of functors.

The set of H-cosets is a cover of G by disjoint open subsets.
(connected locally compact topological groups are sigma-compact)
Every connected locally compact topological group is sigma-compact.
Every locally compact topological group is paracompact.
Then H‚âî‚à™n‚àà‚ÑïC e n‚äÇG is clearly a topological subgroup of G.
Observe that each C e n is compact.
From this we may draw the following conclusions.
Thus G is a disjoint union space of paracompact spaces.
This is again paracompact (by this prop.).
A topological group G carries two canonical uniformities: a right and left uniformity.
The uniform topology for either coincides with the topology of G.
Obviously when G is commutative, the left and right uniformities coincide.
Let f:G‚ÜíH be a group homomorphism.
Hence f is uniformly continuous with respect to the right uniformity.
By similar reasoning, f is uniformly continuous with respect to the right uniformity.
See at geometric quantization and orbit method for more on this.
Why the strong topology is used
continuous homomorphisms of Lie groups are smooth
A proof is spelled out by Todd Trimble here on MO.
This entry is about √©tale morphisms between schemes.
(A number of other equivalent definitions are listed at wikipedia.)
This is analogous to the corresponding characterization of local diffeomorphisms of smooth manifolds.
See at differential cohesion and at infinitesimal shape modality.
Proposition A composite of two √©tale morphism is itself √©tale.
The pullback of an √©tale morphism is √©tale.
Then the three properties to be shown are equivalently the pasting law for pullback diagrams.
Such √©tale morphisms are classified by the classical Galois theory of field extensions.
This appears for instance as (Milne, prop. 2.1).
Every open immersion of schemes is an √©tale morphism of schemes.
To overcome this difficulty, one needs to enlarge this category in various ways.

The fundamental solution of a heat equation is called the heat kernel.
The heat kernel K for P is then the kernel of an integral operator?
Of course, one needs to justify this definition by the proof of the existence.
The heat equation on the other hand can describe diffusion?.

Let S be a set, and let ‚â∫ be a binary relation on S.
A subset A of S is ‚â∫-inductive if ‚àÄ(x:S),(‚àÄ(t:S),t‚â∫x‚áít‚ààA)‚áíx‚ààA.
(Such an x is called a minimal element of A.)
For a topos-theoretic proof see here.
Consider then a set P‚äÇX defined as P={x}‚à™{a‚à£a‚â∫x‚àßQ}.
In the latter case we immediately see that Q holds.
Since Q was an arbitrary proposition, we can deduce ‚àÄQ.(Q‚à®¬¨Q).
It is the inductive notion of well-foundedness that is just right.
Let U={u‚ààX:u‚àâA‚àß(‚àÄx:X),x‚â∫u‚áíx‚àâA}.
So, suppose z is an element such that y‚ààU whenever y‚â∫z.
But this negates the assumption that A has no minimal element.
We must show that every element x‚ààX belongs to U.
Many inductive or recursive notions may also be packaged in coalgebraic terms.
(Note that j is necessarily monic, since P preserves monos.)
This says the same thing as ‚àÄ x:X(‚àÄ y:Xy‚â∫x‚áíy‚ààU)‚áíx‚ààU.
See also well-founded coalgebra.
Then sets so equipped form a category with simulations as morphisms.
See extensional relation for more uses of simulations.
Suppose y‚ààX is an element such that f(u)=g(u) whenever u‚â∫y.
By extensionality, we infer f(y)=g(y), so that y‚ààU.
But infinite descent or direct proof by induction still require ‚â∫ rather than ‚™Ø.
Let S be a finite set.
Then any relation on S whose transitive closure is irreflexive is well-founded.
That this relation is well-founded is the usual principle of mathematical induction.
That this relation is well-founded is the principle of strong induction.
That this relation is well-founded is the principle of transfinite induction.
That this relation is well-founded is the axiom of foundation.
But few or none of these are publically available.

Most often one looks at dynamical systems in which M is a smooth manifold.
Most amazing was that all predictions were confirmed to be remarkably accurate.
This page is about formalizign the notion of spectral sequences in homotopy type theory.
For more see the References below.
What is a spectral sequence?
This one is no exception.)
Spectral sequences are to long exact sequences as iterated extensions are to extensions.
The simplest example is A‚Üí(id,0)A‚äïC‚Üíproj 2C.
The most obvious is that if A=C=0, then also B=0.
The converse also holds: if B=0, then A=C=0.
The sequence might be infinite or finite in either direction.
How are LES‚Äôs related to extensions?
Of course, œÄ n is only an abelian group for n‚â•2.
Feel free to assume all spaces are simply connected.
In this case, the LES of a fibration sequence extends infinitely in both directions.
It‚Äôs more common to describe iterated extensions in terms of filtrations.
When this is the case, one says that the filtration is complete and Hausdorff.
For finite iterated extensions, however, these conditions are all automatic.
relating the homotopy groups of the fibers X s.
Note that deg(i‚Ä≤)=deg(i) and deg(k‚Ä≤)=deg(k), but deg(j‚Ä≤)=deg(j)‚àídeg(i).
We can thus iterate this process.
This structure is called a spectral sequence.
We call this the E 2 page of the spectral sequence.
In this case, we have the following.
Then E pq r has stabilized, so that E pq ‚àû=E pq r.
Suppose Y is an m-type, i.e. œÄ n(Y)=0 for n>m.
Again, the definition of a spectrum makes this independent of k.
It‚Äôs easy to see that this inherits a spectrum structure.
Part one was kind of light on examples, though.
This is called the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence.
This causes the differentials to go down and right rather than left and up.
First we have to generalize our notion of cohomology a bit.
One place they come from is families of abelian groups.
The cohomology of X with coefficients in HA is called cohomology with local coefficients.
Where do local systems come from?
Here‚Äôs a fairly easy one.
When a=1 we do have such a fibration, namely the Hopf fibration.
One last comment deserves to be made.
I‚Äôm not sure how to go about trying to prove that.
(Edit: See below!)
However, there are other ways to do the reindexing.
It seems likely that a similar method would work for the Serre SS.
This dependency is usually written as x,y:obj‚ä¢hom(x,y):Type.

A species is a symmetric sequence by another name.
Meaning: they are categorically equivalent notions.
For more, see structure type.
For more on this see also below the discussion In homotopy type theory.
There are in fact 5 important monoidal structures on the category of species.
The sum A+B of two species A, B is their coproduct A‚àêB.
The generating function of the sum of species is the sum of their generating functions.
The category core(FinSet) becomes a monoidal category under disjoint union of finite sets.
The category of species also has cartesian products.
This operation is often called the Hadamard product of species.
The category core(FinSet) also becomes a monoidal category under cartesian product of finite sets.
This monoidal structure induces another Day convolution monoidal structure on Species:=PSh(core(FinSet)).
(See Dirichlet series and the Hasse‚ÄìWeil zeta function.)
A monoid with respect to the plethysm tensor product is called an operad.
Let FinSet be the type of finite sets (see at hSet).
We give four of the five monoidal structures here.
For more operations, see (Dougherty15).
The generating function is |X‚ãÖY|(z)=|X|(z)‚ãÖ|Y|(z).
A species X assigns an ‚àû-groupoid X n to each natural number n‚àà‚Ñ§.
That coproduct of species maps to sum of their cardinalities is trivial.
then one obtains the notion of Schur functor.
This joint generalisation yields what are called generalised species.
In other words, it is a fixed point of the exponential map Œªx.œâ x.

An (‚àû,1)-functor is a homomorphism between (‚àû,1)-categories.
It may be thought of as a homotopy coherent functor or strongly homotopy functor.
The details of the definition depend on the model chosen for (‚àû,1)-categories.
This serves to define the (‚àû,1)-category of (‚àû,1)-functors.
Let C be an ordinary category.
This is naturally a simplicially enriched category.
Write N(KanCplx) for the homotopy coherent nerve of this simplicially enriched category.

There are two different concepts called Weil algebra.
This entry is about the notion of Weil algebra in Lie theory.
For the notion in infinitesimal geometry see infinitesimally thickened point/local Artin algebra.
The notion of Weil algebra is ordinarily defined for a Lie algebra ùî§.
Let ùî§ be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra.
We first consider Weil algebras of L-‚àû algebras, then more generally of L-‚àû algebroids.
A quick abstract way to characterize the Weil algebra of ùî§ is as follows.
Notice that a free object is unique up to isomorphism .
For more on this see at adjusted Weil algebra.
So let T be a Fermat theory.
Write TAlg for the corresponding category of algebra.
See the corresponding entries for more details.
This implies the following universal freeness property:
We want to show that f is actually a dgca morphism.
This is the identity on the unshifted generators, and 0 on the shifted generators.
This means that homotopy-theoretically the Weil algebra is the point.
Dually, the ‚àû-Lie algebra inn(ùî§) is a model for the point.
In fact, it is a groupal model for universal principal ‚àû-bundles.
This is discussed at ‚àû-Lie algebra cohomology.
(See at geometry of physics ‚Äì differential forms).
Concersely, the Cartan models form a generalization of the Weil algebra.
See at equivariant de Rham cohomology ‚Äì Cartan model for more.
In the following we discuss these inner automorphism ‚àû-Lie algebras in more detail.
(See section 6 of (SSSI)).
Let ùî§ be a finite dimensional Lie algebra.
For illustration, we spell this out in a basis.
Their Œ¥ E is our d CE.
Their Œ¥ Œ∏ is our d œÅ (Œ∏/œÅ denoting the representation)..

We discuss these axiomatizations below in Formalization.
We discuss two different (but closely related) formalizations of these ideas.
Within the context of this geometry, we make the following definitions:
One such set of axioms is cohesion.
See at differential cohesion for how this works.
This connects the ‚Äúgros‚Äù perspective back to the ‚Äúpetit‚Äù perspective.
an axiomatization of generalized geometry is proposed in terms of 1-category theory.
The evident generalization of this to (‚àû,1)-category theory provides an axiomatization for higher geometry.
This is discussed at cohesive (‚àû,1)-topos.
At the heart of Spinoza‚Äôs system is his concept of substance
He claims that substance thus understood is God.
Spinoza‚Äôs system is that of Descartes made objective in the form of absolute truth.
Spinoza‚Äôs first definition is of the Cause of itself.
The second definition is that of the finite.
That is the affirmative side of the limit.
The third definition is that of substance.
Spinoza, like Descartes, accepts only two attributes, thought and extension.
An infinite numerical series in mathematics is exactly the same thing.
Spinoza here also employs geometrical figures as illustrations of the Notion of infinity.
Does substance, one might here ask, possess an infinite number of attributes?
‚ÄúThe attribute is that which the understanding thinks of God.‚Äù
and whence come these two forms themselves?
It is a simple chain of reasoning, a very formal proof.
‚ÄúEvery attribute must be conceived for itself,‚Äù as determination reflected on itself.
If not, infinite substance would cease to exist, which is absurd.‚Äù(3)
By these proofs and others like them not much is to be gained.
God is therefore the absolute First Cause.‚Äù
God has not therefore any other thoughts which He could not have actualized.
‚ÄúHis essence and His existence are the same, namely, the truth.
In nature nothing is contingent.
God acts in accordance with no final causes (sub ratione boni).
God is an extended Being for the same reason.‚Äù
These then are Spinoza‚Äôs general forms, this is his principal idea.
Some further determinations have still to be mentioned.
We further find consciousness taken into consideration.
Truth is for Spinoza, on the other hand, the adequate.(7
Spinoza, however, also accepts both in their separation from one another.
Determination of the will (volitio) and Idea are one and the same thing.
All Ideas, in so far as they are referable to God, are true.
God Himself loves Himself with an infinite intellectual love.
This is therefore the purest, but also a universal morality.
The affirmative is the will, the intention, the act of Nero.
‚ÄúWherein then consists Nero‚Äôs criminality?
For in this way God and the respect to our understanding are different.
How is this to be conceived?
Reason cannot remain satisfied with this ‚Äúalso,‚Äù with indifference like this.
Spinoza‚Äôs system is absolute pantheism and monotheism elevated into thought.
They are many degrees worse than Spinoza.
The propositions have, as such, a subject and predicate which are not similar.
The result as proposition ought to be truth, but is only knowledge.
But whence have we these categories which here appear as definitions?
We find them doubtless in ourselves, in scientific culture.
There is lacking the infinite form, spirituality and liberty.
Thought has only the signification of the universal, not of self-consciousness.
But the reason that God is not spirit
is that He is not the Three in One.

A further transformation occured with the notion of topos.
Illusie introduced the notion of weak equivalence of simplicial presheaves on a Grothendieck site.
Maltsiniotis points out that Batanin‚Äôs definition is the closest to Grothendieck‚Äôs original idea.
Grothendieck also mentionned, somewhat cryptically, a potential application to stratified spaces.
See below at 1-Loop amplitudes.
Cumrun Vafa is a string theorist at Harvard.
Introducing the idea of F-theory:
That leads to the concept of a commutative invertible magma.
Every commutative loop is a commutative invertible unital magma.
Every commutative invertible quasigroup is a commutative invertible magma.
Every abelian group is a commutative invertible monoid.
The empty magma is a commutative invertible magma.
This entry contains a basic introduction to getting equivariant cohomology from derived group schemes.
Let A be an E ‚àû-ring.
Let E(A) denote the ‚àû-groupoid of oriented elliptic curves over SpecA.
The point is to prove the following due to Lurie.
Then we can define A S 1(*)=O(G).
Now let T be a compact abelian Lie group.
Define the Pontryagin dual, T^ of T by T^:=Hom Lie(T,S 1).
Let B be an A-algebra.
Define M T by M T(B):=Hom AbTop(T^,G(B)).
Further, M T is representable.
There exists a map M^ such that the assignment T‚Ü¶M T factors as T‚Ü¶M^(BT).
Further, such factorizations are in bijection with the preorientations of G. Proof.
That such a factorization exists defines M^ on objects.
Now we need a map BT‚Ä≤‚ÜíHom(M T,M T‚Ä≤).

For trivial actions there is no dependence on the preorientation.
Remark F T(X) is actually a sheaf of algebras.
We now verify loop maps on A T.
Define L V=F T(BV,SV).
A T preserves equivalence;
Via homotopy equivalence (1) we reduce to X=T/T 0.

The theory is very similar and generalizes the discrete case of the ringed spaces.
This is (EH, theorem 7.2).
Then applying Lie differentiation yields a foliation of the Lie algebroid Lie(ùí¢ ‚Ä¢).

The possible degrees run between d=1 and d=9.
Topologically, del Pezzo surfaces are determined by their degree except for d=8.

This is known as the worldsheet parity operator.
The hypothesis I want to explore is that generalisation can be represented as an adjunction.
So perhaps other readers can supply technical substantiation or refutation.
If I can ever get funding then of course I‚Äôll do so as well.
But suppose that many kinds of generalisation can be formulated as adjunctions.
Then what properties distinguish those adjunctions from others?
If none, does this mean that all adjunctions can be regarded as generalisations?
If so, does that tell us anything useful about adjunctions?
What is a concept?
I haven‚Äôt said anything about what a concept is.
Here are some examples.
The examples are two-dimensional points (members of R 2).
Generalisation is least-squares fitting, as above.
The concept is a line giving the best least-squares fit to the points.
Generalisation is fitting of some other statistical model.
The concept is an instance of that model.
The examples are logical sentences, classified as positive or negative.
Generalisation is training a linear-associator neural net.
Generalisation is nearest-neighbour prediction.
It can therefore be used to predict the preferred party of other voters.
I‚Äôve taken this example from Truth from Trash by Chris Thornton.
The examples are the instances of generalisation given in this write-up.
Generalisation is fitting each to a notion in category theory.
See also the following section.
Let there be an arrow from P to P‚Ä≤ if P implies P‚Ä≤.
This makes C into a partial ordering defined by implication.
It has the obvious partial ordering by inclusion.
G and F reverse arrows, as in the next example.
The above is trivial, but I find it suggestive.
Now, we also know that in C, their conjunction is their limit.
So one object would be e(1),e(2).
Interpret the arrows in E as set inclusion.
Interpret the arrows as implication.
Now define G as follows.
G maps each singleton e(I) to the sentence e(I).
It maps sets with more than one element to the universally-quantified sentence.
It also reverses arrows, mapping set inclusion to reverse implication.
The functor G is ‚Äúdoing the best it can‚Äù in these circumstances.
Let E‚Äòs objects be the non-empty sets of colinear elements of R 2.
Once again, let the arrows be set inclusion.
Let the arrows be set inclusion.
G maps inclusions to inclusions.
As with the previous instance, G flattens most of E into C.
All the instances above can be formalised as adjunctions.
3. G and F satisfy the Galois connection condition.
4. A Galois connection is a special case of an adjunction.
The first point follows from the orderings I imposed on E and C.
It holds also for G, because it can‚Äôt ‚Äúcross over‚Äù.
The third point follows by simple calculation with these orders.
The fourth is a standard result.
Given any object c in C, there is a morphism taking every GFc to c.
Hence we get one natural transformation.
See also sections on ‚ÄúChange of language‚Äù below.
But I feel I‚Äôm missing something else.
What‚Äôs the essence?
A least-squares fit maps a set of points e i as follows.
Some points e good fall exactly onto the regression line.
Others, e bad, don‚Äôt.
What property is common to all points on a regression line?
I need fonts to distinguish between sets of examples and their elements‚Ä¶
(I need to complete this and the following examples.)
In this, I‚Äôm leading up to generalisation in simple neural networks.
Think of learning a linear transformation.
E is the category of sets of pairs ‚ü®v,w‚ü©.
(What does F do, and is it unique?)
Ought it to be some kind of completion of C above?
C will depend very tightly on how the associator is trained.
(Also to be completed.)
Let E be the category of real pairs ‚ü®h,t‚ü©.
Let C be the category of real pairs whose elements sum to 1.
Let G map ‚ü®h,t‚ü© to ‚ü®h/(h+t),t/(h+t)‚ü©.
Let F be the identity.
(Are E and C discrete?)
I don‚Äôt know what to call this, but it feels relevant.
It‚Äôs a picture that came to me.
Imagine that E is the category of subsets of R 2.
(I‚Äôm being intentionally vague.)
Now let E‚Ä≤ and C also be the category of subsets of R 2.
(Assume there is a unique intersection.)
Let G=G 1;G 2.
Let G translate each ‚Ä¶..
Imagine various views of a physical object such as a leather armchair.
Then we can merge these to make a composite view.
Set union is a special case of it.
But in real life, different views might disagree on their overlaps.
That also feels like a colimit.
We can regard the solution as being an initial object in a category of solutions.
5. But concepts are not physical objects
I don‚Äôt know whether one should call such reconstruction ‚Äúgeneralisation‚Äù.
6. Which may be related to‚Ä¶
The first is called continuous perception and the second categorical perception.
Categorical perception (CP) can be inborn or can be induced by learning.
Categorical perception (CP) can be inborn or can be induced by learning.
Another idea that I want to capture is that of least general generalisation.
But I want to think of it more generally.
10. Implying as little as possible
It contains the information we need to reconstruct the examples, but nothing else.
This property too is something that I believe a generalisation should have.
This leads me to the intuition that generalisation can be represented as a limit.
I suppose there are various reasons for this: * Saving memory.
A mere conjunction can‚Äôt do that.
Can one regard that as a kind of generalisation?
For example, a linear regression line can‚Äôt represent non-colinear points exactly.
(Is this intuition worth formalising?)
Draw a grid on R 2 of cells of side 1.
Then F and G form a Galois connection.
This is worth looking into.
An original discussion is (Sullivan 05, prop. 1.18).

This originates around (Bousfield-Kan 72, VI.8.1).

A quick survey is in (Riehl 14, theorem 14.4.14).

Later the term free differential algebra, abbreviated FDA was used instead and became popular.

Such morphisms are the integrated version of flat ‚àû-Lie algebroid valued differential forms.
Physicists speak of instanton solutions.
We call Œª the gauge parameter .

Proof Let Œ© ‚Ä¢(X)‚üµŒºW(ùî§) be a given form.
We discuss how actional functionals for supergravity theories are special cases of this.
This condition is called the cosmo-cocycle condition in (DAuriaFre).
In DAuriaFre p. 9 this system of equations is called the cosmo-cocycle condition .
So d W(ùî§)Œª=d CE(ùî§)Œª+dŒª=d CE(ùî§)Œª+‚àë ar a‚àßŒπ t aŒª.
Therefore the extra sign (‚àí1) |t a| that we display does not appear.
Let ùî§=ùî∞ùî≤ùî§ùîØùîû 6 be the supergravity Lie 6-algebra.

The first term gives the Palatini action for gravity.

We argue by induction that each skeleton is a paracompactum.
Vacuously X ‚àí1=‚àÖ is a paracompactum.

sober maps from compact spaces to Hausdorff spaces are closed and proper
In the context of geometric quantization of symplectic manifolds these arise as prequantum bundles.
But prequantum geometry is of interest in its own right.
Then every continuous function of the form K‚ü∂fY is uniformly continuous.
This however would contradict the assumption that d Y(f(x k),f(y k))>œµ.
Hence we have a proof by contradiction.

The object through which f factors is called the full image of f.
This means that this is an enhanced factorization system?.
This factorization system can be constructed using generalized kernels.
The maximal elongation is usually called the amplitude of oscillation.
Many partial differential equations for the mechanics of extended objects have wave solutions.
The amplitude depends both on the time and the position in space.
Finite superpositions have many typical features (e.g. Lissajous figures).
One then talks about a wave packet.
A wave packet can from far away look like a point particle.
Linear superposition is thus one of the basic features of quantum mechanics.

It is therefore even a stalkwise isomorphism.

Of course the bulk of the literature considers non-relativistic supersymmetric quantum mechanics.

This unification notably captures central aspects of T-duality.
The following definition may be thought of as combining these two concepts.
The following shows that this is indeed a joint generalization of complex and symplectic structures.

This discussion began when I asked the following questions:
If this is not a natural transformation, is there another name for it?
If so, why don‚Äôt we define natural transformation in this more general way?
It seems more ‚Äúnatural‚Äù to me.
The whole thing just wants to bumped up incrementally in dimension.
If this is not a natural transformation, is there another name for it?
If so, why don‚Äôt we define natural transformation in this more general way?

Then this is a square in the 2-category of categories.
I was hesitant to put that 2-arrow in there.
I‚Äôm still learning this stuff and am on shaky ground.
If nothing, then I would call such a thing a square of functors.
And there should be a universal property which gives the right such category.
So morphisms in D C should correspond to functors 2‚ÜíD C.
This is an exercise well worth working out.
I think I got it.
Does this guy have a name?
The reason why I bring this up is that I do not like bigons.
Bigons are not a good shape for doing computational geometry, geometric realization, etc.
I still like this more general definition.
Here is my attempt to formalize an alternative definition:
This is exactly what I was talking about at Natural Transformation.
I would call it a lax commutative square of functors.

Let P abr a‚àßr b‚ààW(ùî§) be the Killing form invariant polynomial.
See (Zanelli).
This is from (SSSI).
Therefore ‚ü®‚àí‚ü© ùî§ 1 is a Chern-Simons element for it.
So in particular Œº being a cocycle means that d CE(ùîû)Œº={Œº,Œº}=0.
To safe typing signs, we write as if all functions were even graded.
By standard reasoning the computation holds true then also for arbitrary grading.
Similarly, using that by definition d CE(ùîû)Œº=0 we have d W(ùîû)Œº=dŒº.
So in total we have d W(ùîû)(12Œπ œµœâ‚àíŒº)=12œâ.

Throughout, our topos is denoted ùíû.
We now want to identify conditions under which ‚ãÑ /X is itself a monad.
First observe that the unit-like map is canonically present.
Therefore by the universal property of the pullback they have to coincide.
We now claim that this yields indeed a monad on the slice.
If moreover ‚ãÑ is idemponent, then so is ‚ãÑ /X. Proof
In this form we will mostly state this condition in the following.
Hence the claim follows by the universal property of the pullback.
This is naturally a (pointed) topologically enriched category itself.
A cosimplicial algebra is a cosimplicial object in the category of algebras.
A cohesive site is a small site whose topos of sheaves is a cohesive topos.

Finally we need to show that ŒìX‚ÜíŒ† 0X is an epimorphism for all X.
Hence Sh(C) is a locally connected topos.
Moreover, since C is cosifted, Œ† 0 preserves finite products.
In particular, Sh(C) is connected and even strongly connected.
Next, we claim that C is a local site.
The right adjoint Codisc of Œì is defined by CoDisc(A)(U)=A C(*,U)=A Œì(U).

Consider a category C equipped with the trivial coverage/topology.
The first two conditions ensure that Sh(C)=PSh(C) is a cohesive topos.
If a subcategory on contractible spaces, then this is also an (‚àû,1)-cohesive site.
The axioms are readily checked.
Notice that the cohesive topos over ThCartSp is the Cahiers topos.
The cohesive concrete objects of the cohesive topos Sh(CartSp) are precisely the diffeological spaces.
See cohesive topos for more on this.
The choice is such that cells map composites of images to images of composite.
With the opposite choice one speaks of an oplax (or sometimes colax) functor.
A normal lax functor (sometimes called strictly unitary) preserves identities strictly.
There exist a similar concept for double and multiple categories.
If we add icons as 2-cells, this becomes a 2-category.
Any lax monoidal functor gives an example.
Similarly, oplax functors *‚ÜíD are equivalent to comonads in D.
Another special case arises when D=BV for some monoidal category V.
Some old remarks on this case are in Note on lax functors and bimodules.
A general discussion of lax-oplax functors is in section 2.1 there.
Is there a name for something like that?
The interesting examples listed above (and others) don‚Äôt use any such condition.
For the case of Lie groups this is also called Klein geometry.
The collection of these distinguished squares is then called a ‚Äúcd-structure‚Äù.

Any cd-structure gives rise in a canonical way to a Grothendieck topology on C.
Let œá be a complete cd-structure.

Below we only discuss the definition of these spaces over a field k.
This definition does not quite work over fields of positive characteristic.
In general one has to take cycles as described by Denis-Charles Cisinski below.
In characteristic zero both coincide.
The link to higher Chow groups however only becomes apparent in the cycle description.
To keep things simple, let us assume we work over a perfect field k.
For higher n, here is the following construction due to Voevodsky.

Let V be a differential BV-algebra over a field of characteristic zero.
Let H be its homology.
This uses some kind of twisted differential cohomology version of KR theory.

A reflexive coequalizer is a coequalizer of a reflexive pair.
A category has reflexive coequalizers if it has coequalizers of all reflexive pairs.
Reflexive coequalizers should not be confused with split coequalizers, a distinct concept.
This is the case particularly if T preserves reflexive coequalizers.
This is due to (Linton).
Suppose C T has reflexive coequalizers.
That this reflexive coequalizer is the coproduct ‚àë iA i in C T is routine.
Finally, a category with coproducts and reflexive coequalizers is cocomplete.
(See also the lemma on page 1 of Johnstone‚Äôs Topos Theory.)
Therefore, by proposition , Set T is cocomplete.
Applications Reflexive coequalizers figure in the crude monadicity theorem.

How do you reflect on that?
(00:43) Reflecting on M-theory is quite a big challenge.
The story of M-theory began with the story of eleven dimensions.
(01:16) That involves compactifying the 11 dimensions down to 4.
(01:23) That had its problems.
The theories we looked at were not phenomenologically very promising.
However, that view was not a popular one, I have to say.
(03:46) That was the conventional view.
[see Ho≈ôava-Witten 95, p. 2]
So, M-theory had a strange history.

The first case corresponds to periodic integral cohomology.

But the definition works more generally
RMod is an abelian category
Let the ambient monoidal category be Ab equipped with the tensor product of abelian groups.
Then RMod is an abelian category.
In fact RMod is a Grothendieck category.
We discuss now all the ingredients of this statement in detail.
Let U:RMod‚ÜíSet be the forgetful functor to the underlying sets.
RMod has all cokernels.
The defining universal property of kernel and cokernels is immediately checked.
Let then g 1:N 2‚ÜíN 2im(f) be the natural projection.
and let g 2:N 2‚Üí0 be the zero morphism.
The other direction is evident on elements.
This makes RMod into an Ab-enriched category.
The defining universal properties are directly checked.
The tensor unit is R regarded canonically as an R-module over itself.
By the bilinearity of œï both of these are R-linear maps.
Let R be a ring.
See for instance (Kiersz, prop. 3).

If G is commutative ‚Ñä is abelian.

Can we talk about Grothendieck universes or analogous size-related mechanisms?
I‚Äôd certainly like to, subject to real-world time constraints.
This family should be isomorphic to the family I‚Ü¨A.
This leads us to wonder how to define two families to be isomorphic.
Fix a family of sets U‚Ü¨E.
So here‚Äôs a formulation that I think is more in the spirit of SEAR.
If A is U-small, then so is PA.
It also follows that coproducts and quotient sets preserve smallness.
Now consider a tabulation B‚Ä≤‚ÜêrZ‚ÜísY of M‚àòf.
The naming of these two properties appears to be traditional, however.
See in particular the book Algebraic Set Theory by Joyal and Moerdijk.
Hence U-small functions are closed under dependent products.
Clearly the third condition implies the second.
The second implies the first, since pullbacks have isomorphic fibers.
Thus the difficulty is in showing that the first implies the second.
Suppose that f:B‚ÜíA is U-small.
Since f is U-small, p is surjective.
Since each h is a bijection, k makes P a pullback of |E|.
Let M be a monoid.
We say that an element a‚ààM is a unit if it is invertible.
Every abelian group is trivially a unique factorization monoid.
Thus, this idea seems to be very unlikely.
Approaches to a full quantization of gravity therefore roughly fall into two different strategies
This is the approach taken for instance in string theory.
This expected decay process cannot be described without a theory of quantum gravity.
If true this would mean that a quantization of gravity in standard QFT is possible.
(See there for references on gravity).
Accordingly there are suggestions to modify instead the principles of perturbative quantum field theory.
But various central questions remain open and the state of the theory remains somewhat inconclusive.
(See first-order formulation of gravity).
Research in this direction has therefore become known as loop quantum gravity .
It is is not clear how this configuration space relates to that of ordinary gravity.
The problem with discriminating between all these proposals is the combination of two problems.
For details see there.

This phenomenon is hence known as wall crossing.
Hence coherent sheaves are a slight generalization of complex vector bundles.
This is a generalization of the classical magnetic charge known from Dirac charge quantization.
Let ùíú be an additive category.
Let ùíú be an abelian category equipped with a stability condition (Def. ).
A motivating example for the concept of Bridgeland stability is the following classical notion.
Let X be a non-singular, projective curve over ‚ÑÇ.
Let ùíú=Coh(X) be the category of coherent sheaves on X.
The classical notion of the slope of a vector bundle is Œº(E)‚âîdeg(E)rk(E)
Thus Bridgeland stability generalizes the classical notions of stability of vector bundles.

Abstract clones are equivalent to Lawvere theories, and also to finitary monads.
This is the notion that‚Äôs equivalent to a cartesian operad or a Lawvere theory.
Here we write n=(x 1‚Ä¶x n).
These are the equations that are true in all models of the theory.
The Œ∑ and c respect equivalence relations because we closed under substitution instances and congruence.
Conversely, any abstract clone can be regarded as a presentation of an algebraic theory.
The identity morphisms are Œ∑ n.
Composition is (g‚àòf)(i)=(g(i)‚ä≥j.f(j)).
This category is a Lawvere theory.
This gives an equivalence between abstract clones and Lawvere theories.
For example, an algebra for the abstract clone of groups is a group.
Now the category of T-algebras has a forgetful functor T‚àíAlg‚ÜíSet
Thus every abstract clone gives rise to a monad.
Conversely, suppose that M is a monad on the category of sets.
This gives an equivalence between finitary monads and abstract clones.
They are also the monads with arities in FinSet.
The definition of abstract clones given here is itself a presentation of algebraic structure.
In fact this adjunction is enriched in [FinSet,Set].

Notably we need to be talking about differential forms on Œì Œ£(E).
This structure on Œì Œ£(E) is called the structure of a diffeological space:
For more background on diffeological spaces see also geometry of physics ‚Äì smooth sets.
(Cartesian spaces are diffeological spaces)
More generally, the same construction makes every smooth manifold a smooth set.
(Fr√©chet manifolds are diffeological spaces)
Consider the particular type of infinite-dimensional manifolds called Fr√©chet manifolds.
For more background on this see at geometry of physics ‚Äì smooth sets.
First we verify that the concept of smooth sets is a consistent generalization:
(diffeological spaces are smooth sets)
This function is a bijection.
That this is functorial is just the standard fact (?) from prop. .
The only diffeological space with this property is ‚Ñù 0=* itself.
Therefore the smooth sets Œ© k for k‚â• are not diffeological spaces.
This appears notably in the construction of phase spaces below.
The corresponding infinitesimally thickened point is often denoted ùîª 1(k)‚âîSpec((‚Ñù[[œµ]])/(œµ k+1)).
All the remaining elements are proportional to œµ, and hence are nilpotent.
Thus f * as above is uniquely fixed.
This in turn means equivalently that ‚àÇ:C ‚àû(‚Ñù n)‚ÜíC ‚àû(‚Ñù n) is a derivation.

Mike: Created quantale, adjoint functor theorem, and total category.
Asked some questions at fundamental group of a topos.
Tim: Created fundamental group of a topos.
Wrote congruence to mean an internal equivalence relation.
(Perhaps Mike Shulman knows.)
Modified Froelicher space a little as well in line with the Isbell envelope nomenclature.
Zoran ≈†koda created Waldhausen category and made a remark into entry cofibration category.
I created symmetric set out of material that Zoran ≈†koda added to FinSet.
Similarly, I moved predicativism to predicative mathematics.
To go with this, I finally created FinSet.
Created Loday-Pirashvili category, dense functor and equivariant object.
I have started a discussion on the exposition of dg-algebra.
My preferred approach is via graded object, differential algebra and chain complex.
The present approach I find a bit confusing.
With the (Fukaya) convention used there D 0 should not exist.
Created homotopy equivalence and weak homotopy equivalence.
created I-category which includes an alternative axiomatisation of cylinder functor.
This is needed for Baues‚Äô version of abstract homotopy theory.
Some results and examples will need to be added later.
Bruce Bartlett has created nInsights.
Those interested in foundations may be particularly interested in my proposed alternative definition of sequence.
I have included a discussion of the nerve of an internal category at that entry.
I have changed the initial sentence of homotopy n-type.
I think this is converging well thanks to the efforts of Mike and Toby.
But I only wrote #Idea# sections.
Responded at homotopy n-type and proset.
Have we a policy as to how to handle terms with perfectly acceptable multiple meanings?
I have tried to ‚Äòbetter‚Äô the previous entry on profinite group!
(see the old version to see why I say it this way.)
Broke undirected object off of directed object as planned.
Finally wrote full subcategory and directed links to it.
I've continued the conversation that Eric Forgy started at preorder.
I have my own terminological question at linear relation.
To this end I have created a sort of historical entry on algebraic homotopy.
Created cofibration category as the first of the ‚ÄòBauesian‚Äô detailed entries.
Also order, but that's just a list of links to more specific pages.
But I got sidetracked writing linear order and loset instead.
Spun simplicial groupoid off of simplicially enriched category.
Classical propositional calculus has an algebraic model, namely a Boolean algebra.
This is as well as the geometric semantics using frames.
The term polymodal algebra is then used for the general case.
The general theory is discussed in the Survey by Goldblatt (see the references).
Let ùîâ=(W,R) be a frame.
The proof is a simple manipulation of the definitions.
The dual operator l is given by l(T)={w‚ààW‚à£‚àÄt‚ààT¬¨Rwt}.
(Again look at this for the preorder and equivalence frame cases.)
(For convenience each has been given a separate entry.)
A preordered set, or proset, is a set equipped with a preorder.
The existence of such a morphism corresponds to the truth of the relation x‚â§y.
Any preordered set is equivalent to a poset.
Let (P,‚â§) be a preorder.
Then the quotient set P/‚àº is a poset.
For more on this perspective see at Segal space ‚Äì Examples ‚Äì In Set.
When treated in this sense, preordered sets are not equivalent to posets.
This appears as (Rosolini, prop. 2.1).
This appears as (Rosolini, corollary. 2.3).
The right-hand square is commutative and this square defines a homotopy lifting problem.
If œÄ is a fibration this universal homotopy lifting problem has a solution, say sÀú:Cocyl(p)√óI‚ÜíE.
One can easily check that this map is a section of œÄ !.
The lifting is then given by sÀú‚àò(Œ∏√óid I):Y√óI‚ÜíE.
Simple checking finishes the proof.
Of course there are many other equivalent characterizations of Hurewicz fibrations.

So Bishop-compactness is really equivalent to ordinary compactness in a strong sense.
Completeness and total boundedness are not individually topological invariants.
A Banach algebra is in particular a topological algebra.
The four lemma is one of the basic diagram chasing lemmas in homological algebra.
It follows directly from the salamander lemma.
It directly implies the five lemma.
Understood in (‚àû,1)-topos theory this is the homotopy quotient X‚´ΩG.
For global quotient orbifolds this is the topological quotient space X/G.
Consider the unit sphere S(‚Ñù‚äïV) where ‚Ñù carries the trivial representation.
Proposition (G-representation spheres are G-CW-complexes)
This equivalence sends an injective topos to its category of points.
This occurs as theorem 4.5 in Lucyshyn-Wright (2011).
Set is the only injective Boolean topos (cf Johnstone 2002, p.740).
Other possible terms are conjugate, transpose, and mate.
An approach to Lagrange inversion using Heisenberg-Weyl algebra is in
In these well adapted models ordinary differential geometry is therefore faithfully embedded.
The result is called a super smooth topos.
See there for a list of models of these.

Broadly, quantum noise is noise in the context of quantum physics.

Here are the entries on the previous sessions:
Let M Der be the derived Deligne-Mumford moduli stack of oriented elliptic curves.
The Tate curve defines a cohomology theory K Tate (an elliptic spectrum).
Note that SAB does not contain tori.
SAB in essence is completely determined by the supergroup ‚Ñù 2|1.
For each n‚àà‚Ñ§, we have AFT n‚âÉ(K Tate) n. Proof.
Let E be a degree 0 field theory.
The spectral argument follows from having an S 1 action.
Under E the vector fields map to L,L¬Ø, and G respectively.
Let F 0={{0},‚Ñ§ ‚â•0}, so X F 0=SpecR[‚Ñ§ ‚â•0]=SpecR[q].
Also, let F=‚ü®œÉ n‚ü© n‚àà‚Ñ§, where œÉ n={(a,b)‚àà‚Ñ§√ó‚Ñ§|na‚â§b‚â§(n+1)a}.
Similarly, define R[[q]] as the formal completion of R[q] along q=0.
That is, there exists a unique derived scheme T‚ÜíSpecR[[q]] such that T^=SpfT.
We call the derived scheme T in the theorem above the Tate curve.
There are many subtleties associated with M Der¬Ø.
The global sections of the structure sheaf thus constructed is the spectrum tmf.
Every proposition has a homotopy level of 1.
Every set has a homotopy level of 2.
A more abstract definition was given in Nikolaus-Scholze 17:1
An ordered group is not the same thing as a group object in Pos.
The underlying additive group of any ordered field is an ordered group.
Non-abelian examples include free groups and torsion-free nilpotent groups.
Saul Kripke was an American philosopher and logician (1940-2022).
Suppose that A is a type which has untruncated decidable equality.
Then A is a h-set.
Let d be the given section.
Canceling q, we obtain a path from p to 1 x.
Idea Category theory is a toolset for describing the general abstract structures in mathematics.
But it is far from the case that all categories are of this type.
Categories are much more versatile than these classical examples suggest.
As such it generalizes the concepts of monoid and poset.
Categories were named after the examples of concrete categories.
Category theory reflects on itself.
Categories are about collections of morphisms.
And there are evident morphisms between categories: functors.
And there are evident morphisms between functors: natural transformations.
General statements about categories apply to each specific concrete category of mathematical structures.
But abstract nonsense still tends to meet with some resistance.
For instance that functors between two categories form themselves a category: the functor category.
This leads to the notion of presheaf categories and sheaf toposes.
Much of category theory is topos theory.
Category theory has a handful of central lemmas and theorems.
Their proof is typically easy, sometimes almost tautological.
Further information can be found on the applied category theory page.
See category theory vs order theory for more discussion.
The concepts of category, functor and natural transformation were introduced in
And with category theory we are confronted with the same pedagogical problem.
And such is the case.
But the progression does not stop here.
There are maps between functors, and they are called natural transformations.
And it was in order to define these that Eilenberg and MacLane first defined functors.
The Catsters are Eugenia Cheng and Simon Willerton (anyone else?).
Discussion of the relation to and motivation from the philosophy of mathematics includes
It has a highly combinatorial and pictorial, and sometimes also elementary, flavour.
A category is svelte if the class of objects of its skeleton is a set.
In other words svelte category is a category equivalent to a small category.
The expression is probably due to Pierre Gabriel.
This is the same as an essentially small category.
Accordingly one calls Œ£ the worldvolume of the given (n‚àí1)-brane when n>1.
Linear operators on normed spaces are continuous precisely iff they are bounded.
A bornological space retains this property by definition.
Equivalently every seminorm that is bounded on bounded sets is continuous.
The bornology of a given TVS is the family of bounded subsets.
Every inductive limit of Banach spaces is a bornological vector space.
One can consider the underlying real principal bundle Œæ R.
The action functional is real valued.
Path integral is defined for such real action functionals.
Here we assume the type of natural numbers, for detailed discussion see there.
Just briefly: ‚Ñï:Type denotes the inductive type generated from 0:‚Ñï,succ:‚Ñï‚Üí‚Ñï.
Roman Sikorski defined the term ‚Äúdifferential module‚Äù in 1971/72.
Mark Mostow further developed the theory in 1979.
The rule U‚ÜíC ‚àû(U) defines a sheaf on X (denoted C ‚àûX).
The elements of C ‚àû(X) are called smooth functions on X.
This shows that lists are just tuples.
This is Part I of an exposition by Todd Trimble on ETCS.
This is a post on ‚Äúfoundations of mathematics‚Äù (eek!).
That‚Äôs an unfortunate misunderstanding.
I‚Äôm not proposing for a moment to ‚Äúoverthrow‚Äù it.
This is intentionally vague.
The ‚Äúneeds of working mathematicians‚Äù fluctuate over time and place and person.
The first ‚Äúneeds no introduction‚Äù, as they say.
I‚Äôll start with the more familiar ZFC.
This may seem innocent enough, but the consequences are quite far-reaching.
Why is this a big deal?
A reasonable analogue might be dynamical systems.
There are other formulations of ZFC.
My own reaction is that ZFC is perhaps way too powerful!
We turn now to consider a categorical approach, ETCS.
This will require retooling the way we think of mathematical membership.
(Meaning, elements are not themselves presupposed to be sets.)
Civilians call them ‚Äúfunctions‚Äù.
A function x:1‚ÜíX corresponds to an ordinary element of X.
This brings us right to the second point.
It is a firm resolve to always honor context-dependence.
For any real mathematical purpose, this is good enough.)
Clearly, we are witnessing here radical departure from how membership is treated in ZFC.
A few quick answers: no, we don‚Äôt lose any essential freedoms.
Okay, it is probably time to lay out the axioms of ETCS.
This should come as no surprise.
A choice of product c is usually denoted a√ób.
A relation from a to b is an injective function or subset r‚Ü™a√ób.
Under strong extensionality, we may drop the qualifier ‚Äúgeneralized‚Äù.
This completes the list of axioms for ETCS.
To make good on this claim, further discussion is called for.
I plan to take this up later, provided I have the energy for it.
I want to show this need not be the case.)
Let ‚ÄñX‚Äñ denote its support.
See (Fourman-Scedrov) and (KECA).
Thus, splitting of supports can be regarded as a weaker form of excluded middle.
We might pronounce this version as ‚Äúall supports merely split‚Äù.
As before, the truncated version is true under LEM but may fail otherwise.
The ‚Äúworld‚Äôs simplest axiom of choice‚Äù fails.
We write ùí∞ ‚Ä¢:‚â°‚àë (A:ùí∞)A for the type of pointed types in the universe ùí∞.
An element of it will be called a loop at a.
The dual notion, of course, is a pushout or cocartesian square.
We leave the verification of homotopy exactness of all squares to the reader.
, the left-hand square in such an extension must also be a pullback.
We state it in terms of pushouts.
, it suffices to suppose that K=(J‚àñz).
See all references at derivator.
These non-classical combinations of states of subsystems are called entangled states.
States in the image of p are called product states or separable states.
An entangled state is a state which is not a product state.
However, there is also a notion of entanglement for mixed states.
This can be made formal by the following definition.
An example of a local stochastic operation is as follows.
She then measures the ancilla qubit.
Perhaps more surprising is the following result to to Dur, Vidal, and Cirac.
The two states are defined as: |W‚ü©=|100‚ü©+|010‚ü©+|001‚ü©|GHZ‚ü©=|000‚ü©+|111‚ü©
Each of these states yields the structure of a commutative Frobenius algebra.
|GHZ‚ü© yields a special CFA and |W‚ü© yields an ‚Äúanti-special‚Äù CFA.
The following work included the consideration of identical particles into the study of quantum entanglement.
The simplest analogue is the dihedral homology.
The sociology of folklore theorems can be subtle.
Products of local observables are called multilocal observables.
These happen to be also microcausal observables (this example).
A string structure on a manifold is a higher version of a spin structure.
A lift one further step through the Whitehead tower is a Fivebrane structure.
Let X be an n-dimensional topological manifold.
there is a canonical map BSpin(n)‚ÜíB 3U(1)
there is a canonical map BString(n)‚ÜíB 7U(1)
Let the ambient (‚àû,1)-topos by H= ETop‚àûGrpd or Smooth‚àûGrpd.
Write X for a topological manifold or smooth manifold of dimension n, respectively.
That leads to differential string structures.
This decomposition is a special case of th general Whitehead principle of nonabelian cohomology.
Let X be a manifolds with spin structure S:X‚ÜíBSpin.
Write P‚ÜíX for the corresponding spin group-principal bundle.
This kind of definition appears in (Redden, def. 6.4.2).
This uses repeatedly the pasting law for (‚àû,1)-pullbacks.
Discussion for indefinite (Lorentzian) signature is in
Of course, there are dual notions of coreflective subcategory, coreflector, and coreflection.
The right adjoint R is fully faithful.
There exists some natural isomorphism LR‚Üí1 B.
The left adjoint L is dense.
The equivalence of (1) and (2) is this proposition.
The equivalence of (1) and (4) is this Prop..
For (5) see reflective localization.
This is a well-known set of equivalences concerning idempotent monads.
See also the related discussion at reflective sub-(infinity,1)-category.
If the categories are toposes then such embeddings are called geometric embeddings.
The reflector in that case is the sheafification functor.
In particular, C is then also cartesian closed.
This appears for instance as (Johnstone, A4.3.1).
See also at reflective subuniverse.
See Day's reflection theorem for a more general statement and proof.
Such reflective subcategories are sometimes called mono-reflective.
Also note that ‚Äòbireflective‚Äô here does not mean reflective and coreflective.
In this explicit form this appears as (Lurie, prop. 5.5.1.2).
A reflective subcategory of a well-powered category is well-powered.
This is AdamekRosicky, theorem 6.28
(Remark after corollary 6.24 in Adamek-Rosicky book).
In particular, if L preserves finite products, then D is cartesian closed.
This is shown in (BashirVelebil).
Or, an integral domain is a field equipped with numerator and denominator functions.
This makes the inclusion functor precisely a geometric inclusion of toposes.
In a recollement situation, we have several reflectors and coreflectors.
The analogue in noncommutative algebraic geometry is in (Rosenberg 98, prop 4.4.3).
The reflection is given by the homotopy category functor.
sheaf toposes are equivalently the left exact reflective subcategories of presheaf toposes
Related discussion of reflective sub-(‚àû,1)-categories is in Jacob Lurie, Higher Topos Theory
This we discuss next (Def. below).
This matrix has two eigenvectors over the rational numbers (in general).
(See also Conner-Floyd 66, p. 100.)
The resulting invariant is denoted e ‚Ñù (Adams 66, p. 39).
Moreover, the pasting law implies that this bottom middle square is itself homotopy cartesian.
The bottom right square is the homotopy pushout defining ‚àÇ.
Hence we have a diagrammatic construction of an invariant of [c] in ‚Ñö/‚Ñ§.
Let E be a locally small category with all small colimits.
It is called absolutely presentable if the functor preserves all colimits.
(See for instance Lawvere 97.)
But under certain hypotheses, the two notions coincide; see for instance Proposition .
The notion of tiny object is clearly highly dependent on the base of enrichment.
The morphism X‚Üí0 induces a map Hom(X,X)‚ÜíHom(X,0).
This is for instance (BorceuxDejean, prop 2).
See Cauchy complete category for more on this.
Let E denote the presheaf category.
(Compare the result here.)
By assumption this has a further right adjoint f ! and hence preserves all colimits.
By prop. this means that F belongs to C¬Ø‚äÇ[C,Set].
This gives the full inclusion Topos ess(Set,[C,Set]) op‚äÇC¬Ø.

In a cohesive topos Let H be a cohesive (‚àû,1)-topos.
Consider the following basic notion from cohesive (‚àû,1)-topos ‚Äì structures.

Traditional geometric quantization applies to symplectic manifolds but not to Poisson manifolds.
This is symplectic, in higher symplectic geometry.
Its Lie integration is a symplectic groupoid.
But the following similarity might be relevant:
The resulting twisted convolution algebra? is that of compact operators on X/‚Ñ±.
Symplectic groupoids were introduced as intended tools for the quantization of Poisson manifolds in
Let K be a field.
Here is a sample theorem:
Then B is also a complete DVR.
(Intend to solve for y in y 3‚àíxy+1=0 as a Puiseux series in x.)
However, they are all instances of the linearization of a finiteness space.
i.e. we compute the real tropical discriminant.
(Such class functions are usually set-maps.)
Every group character is in particular a class function.

Every span factors as an extremal epi followed by a jointly-monic span.
Every regular category is locally regular.
Factorizations of spans may be obtained by factorizations of single morphisms into a binary product.
is locally regular, but not regular.
Its slice categories are precisely the sheaf toposes of spaces (or locales).
A locally regular category is regular if and only if it has a terminal object.
For composition of relations, we require pullbacks and stable factorizations of spans.
For intersection of binary relations, we require equalizers.
So locally regular categories are essentially the same as tabular allegories.
By Schur's lemma see e.g. here.
A counterexample is given im Kowalski 13, Example 2.7.31.
Also the converse to Prop. is false in general.
The external tensor product of irreducible representations need not be irreducible itself.

In order to understand the definition, we recall a little notation.
Given a field F, the notation F¬Ø denotes an algebraic closure of F.
We require that X F satisfies certain conditions: TODO.
The field extension F/F mod is Galois.
These examples are described in Corollary 2.2 of IUTT IV.
This notion is due to Mochizuki.
In this general form this is due to (May).
This tells us firstly that these cohomology rings are particularly nice.
Thus if œá(G/T)>0 then œÑ‚àòBi * hence Bi * is injective.
This case is typically the default meaning of the ‚Äúsplitting principle‚Äù.
The basic theorem of Hirzebruch series expresses genera via the splitting principle.
But the analogy ranges much deeper than this similarity alone might suggest.
For more review of this see also (Hartl 06).

If f(‚Ñ§+œÑ‚Ñ§)‚Üí0 as œÑ‚Üíi‚àû, we say that f is a cusp form.
Write e for the 0-section of this line bundle.
A modular form of weight k is a section of œâ ‚äók.
This generalizes to the case of other congruence subgroups (as above).
Generally such functions on coset spaces like this are called automorphic forms.
Modular forms can be acted on by Hecke operators (related to Hecke correspondence).
A cusp form is normalized if its first Fourier coefficient is equal to 1.
Modular forms can be used to construct Galois representations.
Known cases include the modularity theorem of TaylorWiles95 and BreuilConradDiamondTaylor2001.
Write MF ‚Ä¢(Œì 0(2)) for the ring of these.
Let X be a scheme over a perfect field k of positive characteristic p.
Note that as a sheaf of sets ùí≤ n is just ùí™ X n.
The ring structure is just the addition and multiplication of the Witt vectors.
The operations on the Witt vectors sheafify as well.
When n‚â•m we have the exact sequence 0‚Üíùí≤ m‚ÜíVùí≤ n‚ÜíRùí≤ n‚àím‚Üí0.

If X is projective then H q(X,ùí≤ n) is a finite Œõ-module.
It is also called the cubical category, although that term can be ambiguous.
Do we have a similar definiton of the globe category?
These satisfy the cubical identities: ‚Ä¶ to be inserted ‚Ä¶
This makes ‚ñ° into a monoidal category.
As a test category The cube category is a test category.

Hence these are solutions used as models in cosmology.
Indeed, an FRW-model is part of the standard model of cosmology.
Let C be a differential graded category.
For a locally connected locale one can define its set of connected components.

But with due care exercised, the stable homotopy category itself is useful.
Historically this was advertised as being a construction free of tools of category theory.
There is also a CW-spectrum-replacement functor Œì.
The smash product of spectra makes the stable homotopy category into a symmetric monoidal category.
A module object over such is a module spectrum.

Equivalently this may be expressed in terms of open subsets:
Under these equivalences, the two conditions are manifestly the same.
Yet another equivalent characterization is in terms of frame homomorphisms:
See also (Johnstone 82, II 1.3).
Hence this is indeed a frame homomorphism œÑ X‚ÜíœÑ *.
Finally, it is clear that these two operations are inverse to each other.
(For the moment see the references at topological insulator etc.)
Their theory is also more general than the homogeneous model theory.
This is the fusion ring of ùíû.

In higher categories sometimes multistep factorizations systems are interesting, like Postnikov towers in topology.
Tried to explain what sort of evil I meant at essential image.
I actually do not think that Toby‚Äôs correction to essential image is correct.
I mean that essential image is removing evil from image.
In bicategory Cat the two are equivalent; in category Cat they are not isomorphic.
I am not sure I know what you mean by external vs internal.

Another is image as a subcategory in literal sense.

Hence it is by no means superimposable to homotopy limits in any case.

Began generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) homotopy.
A general geometric (higher geometric) interpretation has been indicated in Ben-ZviFrancisNadler.
See also this prop.
This case is discussed in (Francis) and (Lurie).
This proved Deligne‚Äôs conjecture.
Various authors later further refined this result.
A summary of this history can be found in (Hess).
Direct proofs of the Deligne conjecture have been given in.
See the discussion of the Examples below.
The general construction can be summarized as follows:
We write œÄ n=œÄ‚àòŒ£ ‚àín.
(The sequence itself is the filtering on X.)
(The sequence itself is the co-filtering on X.)
This appears as (Higher Algebra, def. 1.2.2.9).
Let I be a linearly ordered set.
This is Higher Algebra, def. 1.2.2.2.
By the commutativity of the original pasting diagram these two paths are equivalent.
The equivalence is given by left and right (‚àû,1)-Kan extension.
This is Higher Algebra, lemma 1.2.2.4.
Let X ‚Ä¢ be a filtered object in the sense of def. .
Write X(‚Ä¢,‚Ä¢) for the corresponding ‚Ñ§-complex, according to prop. .
This shows that we indeed have the above sequence of morphisms ‚Üíœï‚Üíœï‚Ä≤‚Üíœà‚Ä≤‚Üíœà.
We can now consider the convergence of the spectral sequence of prop. .
This is due to (Higher Algebra, prop. 1.2.2.14).
A quick review is in (Wilson 13, theorem 1.2.1).
Every sequence of spectra manifests itself on homotopy groups in a spectral sequence.
(See also the title of (Wilson 13)).
Needs further discussion/harmonization.
This exact couple gives rise in the usual way to a spectral sequence.
Let X ‚Ä¢ be a cofiltered object.
Let X ‚Ä¢ be a filtered object in ùíû such that lim‚ÜêX ‚Ä¢ exists.
Review is in (Wilson 13, theorem 1.2.1).
It is thus strongly convergent if K is a finite spectrum.
See at spectral sequence of a simplicial stable homotopy type.
See J-homomorphism and chromatic homotopy for an exposition.
In this form this appears as (Lurie 10, theorem 2).
A review is in (Wilson 13, 1.3).
This appears as (Higher Algebra, remark 1.2.4.4).

The first Chern class is the unique characteristic class of circle group-principal bundles.
The analogous classes for the orthogonal group are the Pontryagin classes.
From here we proceed by induction.
So assume that the statement has been shown for n‚àí1.
Consider the induced Thom-Gysin sequence.
Now by another induction over these short exact sequences, the claim follows.
See determinant line bundle for more.
This is hence often called the top Chern class of the vector bundle.
For n‚àà‚Ñï let BŒπ n:B(U(1) n)‚ü∂BU(n) be the canonical map.
First consider the case n=1.
The classifying space BU(1) is equivalently the infinite complex projective space ‚ÑÇP ‚àû.
Moreover, Bi 1 is the identity and the statement follows.
This implies the claim for k<n.
This completes the induction step.
Let X be a smooth manifold.
Their Chern classes are hence invariants of the linear representations themselves.
See at characteristic class of a linear representation for more.

Ordinary substitution is a meta-level notion, i.e. an operation on syntax.
By contrast, explicit substitutions incorporate a notion of substitution as part of a syntax.
The relation between x‚ü®x‚âîy‚ü© and y is recovered by modifying the reduction relation.
Note that there is no rule for reducing a term of the form (M‚ü®x‚âîN‚ü©)‚ü®y‚âîP‚ü©.
These constructions help to show the correctness of the implementation of the associated type theories.
They can also be modified so as to no longer satisfy extensionality.
And this is how it should be.
The standard semantics should be just that: standard.
It should come as no surprise.
a has type A, written a:A.
The definition is by induction-recursion.
Note that each such collection may itself be a prior inductive definition.
The other judgment forms similarly respect reverse reduction in all positions.
By reflexivity, the specification of which terms have a type is technically redundant.
It is just reiterating the reflexivity instances of equality.
Meaning explanations provide a sense in which type theory is about computational behavior.
For this system, the computational behavior of a term is to return a value.
Here are three paradigmatic examples.
This clause for function types is not the one Martin-L√∂f proposed.
The element equality clause gets an analogous change.
So it‚Äôs a trade-off.
Intuitively, open terms are multi-argument dependent functions.
Respect for equality is enforced in a manner to agree with the function type constructor.
In the end, everybody must understand for himself.
The category of classes has classes as objects and maps of classes as morphisms.
We interpret P(x) as saying that x belongs to the class P.
A relation from A to B is a subclass of A√óB.
The class indexed by i‚ààI is the preimage f *{i}.
The category of classes considered above is not a large category in this sense.
We do not require large categories to be locally small.
Suppose I is a large category.
An I-indexed diagram of classes is defined as follows.
First, we have an I-indexed family of classes f:T‚ÜíI.
(The domain of tr is a class because t and h are sets.)
Finally, the transition map satisfies the usual axioms expected from a functor.
We take T=I√óC with f:T‚ÜíI being the projection map.
The transition map sends (t,h)‚Ü¶t.
The category of classes admits all small limits.
(Observe that P is indeed a class.)
Thirdly, coequalizers of classes exist by Scott's trick.
The category of classes is a primordial example of a category with class structure.
Small maps coincide with open maps.
The universal class is the class of all sets.
This entry contains one chapter of geometry of physics.
But this says in components that h 2=h 1‚ãÖh.
This establishes that œÄ 1 is alspo an equivalence on all hom-groupoids.
This proof also shows that B(‚àí) is in fact the inverse equivalence:
One hence speaks of weak 2-groups.
Specifically for the case of group cohomology, this is the following simple statement.
Let A be an abelian group.
A homotopy between two such morphisms is equivalently a coboundary between two such cocycles.
It is instructive to spell this out in low degree.
Hence this is the cocycle condition.
A similar argument gives the coboundaries.
The inverse equivalence B we call the delooping operation.
For H= ‚àûGrpd this is the May recognition theorem.

Then E admits an orthogonal structure.
Such a reduction is also known as a choice of vielbein.

What Is the QED Project and Why Is It Important?
The third motivation for the QED project is education.
Mathematics is arguably the foremost creation of the human mind.
It will thus provide some antidote to the degenerative effects of cultural relativism and nihilism.
In providing motivations for things, one runs the danger of an infinite regression.
In the end, we take some things as inherently valuable in themselves.
We speculate that this cultural motivation may be the foremost motivation for the QED project.
Fifth, the QED system may help preserve mathematics from corruption.
One can easily imagine corrupting forces that could undermine these achievements.
The QED system could offer an antidote to any such tendency.
Sixth, the ‚Äònoise level‚Äô of published mathematics is too high.
Seventh, QED can help to make mathematics more coherent.
There is mathematical knowledge that is neither taught in classes nor published in monographs.
It is below what mathematicians call ‚Äúfolklore,‚Äù which is explicitly formulated.
Let us call this lower level of unformulated knowledge ‚Äúmathlore‚Äù.
In formalization efforts, we must formalize everything, and that includes mathlore lemmas.
Good mathematicians understand trends and connections in their field.

In both these cases the higher gauge fields are cocycles in ordinary differential cohomology.
The question then is: which line bundle?
This is what the central theorem of (Hopkins-Singer 02) establishes rigorously.
One way to achieve this is to choose a conformal structure on Œ£.
Therefore it provides a complex structure on Œ© 2k+1(Œ£)‚äó‚ÑÇ.
Evidently these provide a decomposition into Lagrangian subspaces.

Let S be any set, and let N be the set of natural numbers.
In weaker foundations, more care may be needed.
Of course, the terms are even less standardised here.
There is a lot of freedom in defining uncountability.
All of these definitions are equivalent!
The set of real numbers is uncountable.
If a set has a denumerable subset, then its power set is uncountable.
In contrast, the set of algebraic numbers is denumerable.
Classically, every set is countable xor uncountable.
Even constructively, a countably indexed set cannot be uncountable.
In Russian constructivism, however, there are subcountable sets that are also uncountable.
In some formalisms of Russian constructivism, every set is subcountably indexed.
The empty set is countable, although not denumerably indexed.
Even constructively, a countable set is empty xor inhabited.
Conversely, every uncountable set is infinite.
Thus classically, a countable set is finite xor denumerable.
Classically (using countable choice), countable unions of countable sets are countable.
Still, he urged Cantor to publish.
However, the argument is acceptable to any non-finitist constructivist.

(Note that this clearly fails in the presence of excluded middle.)
(Again, this is clearly a constructivity property.)
The natural numbers object N is an (external) projective object.
The free topos was first constructed by H. Volger.
(1.(10)31, p.192) Elephant F3, to appear.
In this context the appropriate maps are geometric morphisms.
But this is the standard terminology convention.)
Every semisimple Lie algebra is a reductive Lie algebra.
The (almost) correct definition was probably first written down in StreetCBS.
These are the 2-congruences.
Before we define 2-congruences below in def. , we need some preliminaries.
See prop. below.
D 0‚ÜêD 1‚ÜíD 0 is a two-sided fibration in K.
Suppose first that D 0‚ÜêD 1‚ÜíD 0 is a two-sided fibration.
The quotient q in any 2-congruence is eso.
And there is a refined version where internal functors are replaced by internal anafunctors.
The opposite of a homwise-discrete category is again a homwise-discrete category.
This is theorem below.
A sub-2-category of Cong s(K) is the regular completion of K.
Suppose that K has finite 2-limits.
Then: HDC(K) (def. ) has finite limits.
nCong s(K) is closed under finite limits in HDC(K).
It suffices to deal with finite products, inserters, and equifiers.
Evidently Œ¶(1) is a terminal object.
Also E is an n-congruence if C is, and Œ¶ preserves equifiers.
Thus, Œ¶ is homwise fully faithful.
But this implies f is an equivalence; thus e is eso.
Now suppose that f:D‚ÜíE is any functor in nCong s(K).
There are three ‚Äúproblems‚Äù with the 2-category nCong s(K).
While it is regular, it is not exact.
It doesn‚Äôt remember information about K.
The solution to the first problem is straightforward.
Thus, 2Cong(K) has finite limits.
Finally, by construction clearly the inclusion of 2Cong s(K) preserves finite limits.
For homwise essential-surjectivity, suppose that ker(A)‚ÜêF‚Üíker(B) is an anafunctor.
Thus, Œ¶ is homwise an equivalence.
Thus, Œ¶ is essentially surjective, and hence an equivalence.
The same argument works for discrete objects.
We already know that nCong(K) has finite limits and Œ¶ preserves finite limits.
The rest is very similar to Theorem .
(In fact, C is the image of F‚ÜíB in nCong s(K).)
Thus, A‚ÜêF‚ÜíC is the quotient of its kernel; so nCong(K) is regular.
Thus it remains only to show that K nex/reg is n-exact.
Let K:= Grpd be the 2-category of groupoids.
This is clearly a faithful functor.
Moreover, every morphism in Grpd is trivially a conservative morphism.
So ‚ÑÇ 1‚Üí‚ÑÇ 0√ó‚ÑÇ 0 is a discrete morphism in Grpd.
It follows that ‚ÑÇ is indeed a 2-congruence, def. .
This is evidently the internally discrete category ‚ÑÇ 0‚Üíid‚Üíid‚ÑÇ 0.
This is the homology long exact sequence.
In this respect, a pseudotopological space is a special kind of convergence space.
It is also a reflective subcategory of filter spaces (Thm 10.3).
Note that an ultrafilter clusters at x iff it converges to x.
That is, it is an algebra for the pointed endofunctor ùí∞.
This results in binomial sets.
Idea The notion of coinvariant is dual to that of invariant.
The category of manifolds, it is felt, is not big enough.
The real problem with this is that it is an external characterisation.
The purpose of this page is to study a possible description of manifolds.
The description is motivated by the construction of manifolds of smooth maps?.
The rough idea behind a local addition is simple.
This translates into the transition functions being smooth.
Thus a locally additive space is locally smoothly modelled in its tangent spaces.
We shall also work with the most precise version.
Putting all of this together, we shall use the following definition.
Although the obvious definition, as it stands it is not quite precise.
In this article, we shall use the kinematic tangent space.
This requires that we supply our smooth spaces with a topology.
These both seem quite reasonable!
As a direct consequence of this lifting, we get the following simple result.
The lifting property of a locally additive space implies that these two are the same.
Let (X,Œ∑) be a locally kinematic space.
For x‚ààX, the two smooth structures on T xX agree.
That is, T xX‚ÜíTX is an embedding.
This is smooth and splits the quotient C ‚àû(‚Ñù,X)‚ÜíTX.
The motivation for locally kinematic spaces comes from considering mapping spaces.
All of the categories of generalised smooth space are cartesian closed.
This construction is functorial and satisfies lots of nice properties.
The locally additive structure allows us to construct the inverse.
We need to define an inverse for this map.
This map is defined as follows.
Let Œ±‚ààC ‚àû(S,TX).
Thus we have the required inverse.
With that in place, we can now fill in the missing pieces.
Then C ‚àû(S,X) is again a locally kinematic space.
Then for x‚ààX, the tangent space T xX is a vector space.
Consider the curve t‚Ü¶(Œ∑(tv),Œ∑(u)).
There is, therefore, some interval (‚àíœµ,œµ) for which (Œ∑(tv),Œ∑(u))‚ààV.
Thus we define a map: ‚Ñù√ó(‚àíœµ,œµ)‚ÜíTX,(s,t)‚Ü¶s‚ãÖ(œÄ√óŒ∑) ‚àí1(Œ∑(tv),Œ∑(u)).
Let us write this as œÑ:‚Ñù√ó(‚àíœµ,œµ)‚ÜíX for short.
We note that it is smooth, as it is a composition of smooth maps.
In this case, œÑ is the map (s,(1‚àís)t).
Thus the path is t‚Ü¶Œ∑(tv).
Hence the image of ‚àÇ t is v.
Unravelling this, we get s‚Ü¶Œ∑(su).
Hence the image of ‚àÇ s is u.
Hence œÑ *(‚àÇ s+‚àÇ t) is the sum u+v.
Thus a locally additive space is modelled on vector spaces.
The key difference between these two approaches is that of the starting point.
Our goal is to identify manifold-like objects inside a category of smooth spaces.
This is an equivalence class of neighbourhoods of the diagonal.
Definition Let ùíû be a model category and X‚ààùíû an object.
This is called a good path object if in addition Path(X)‚ÜíX√óX is a fibration.
where Cyl(X)‚ÜíX is a weak equivalence.
This is called a good cylinder object if in addition X‚äîX‚ÜíCyl(X) is a cofibration.
But in some situations one is genuinely interested in using non-good such objects.
Let f,g:X‚ü∂Y be two parallel morphisms in a model category.
We discuss the first case, the second is formally dual.
We discuss the first statement, the second is formally dual.
Factor it as Œ∑:X^‚ü∂‚ààCofZ‚ü∂‚ààW‚à©FibY.
Let f,g:X‚ÜíY be two parallel morphisms in a model category.
Let X be cofibrant.
Let Y be fibrant.
We discuss the first case, the second is formally dual.
Let Œ∑:Cyl(X)‚ü∂Y be the given left homotopy.
where on the right we have the chosen path space object.
Now the composite Œ∑Àú‚âîh‚àòi 1 is a right homotopy as required.
See the references at model category.

The symmetrized trace proposal has become widely accepted.
Correction terms have been proposed in
We can generalise further to multiary functions, or functions of several variables.
The possible definitions depend on foundations; for us, the simplest is probably this:
We write f(x,y) for f((x,y)).
Again, we write f(x,y) for f((x,y)).
The link is provided by the binary version of a partial function:
This is called a curried representation.
One can give a similar comparison of material and structural versions of this definition.
In addition, this definition is usually the one used in type theory.
More generally, we can consider any monoidal category.
Similarly, the curried definition makes sense internal to any closed category.
A binary function to the set of truth values is a binary relation.
(This is already the most interesting case in applications in physics.)

However, these permutations all follow automatically for a cyclic relation.
As with a linear order, not all of these axioms are needed.
In this sense proper topological groupoids generalize compact groups.

In view of this and remark one considers the following.
Let (ùíû,‚äó) be a symmetric monoidal (‚àû,1)-category.
Then the corresponding action groupoid V//G sits in the fibration sequence V‚ÜíV//G‚ÜípBG.
In this sense a section is a twisted function.

Then we have the following isomorphism for each p: H p(X,ùíú)‚âÉ(H p(XÀú)‚äóA¬Ø) œÄ.
Whether the decomposition hypothesis actually holds may depend on the properties of the group œÄ.
Other cases, have to be examined individually.

These ùíµ Œõ are called counterterms (remark below)

First consider some convenient shorthand: For n‚àà‚Ñï, write ùíµ ‚â§n‚âî‚àë1‚àà{1,‚ãØ,n}1n!Z n.
We proceed by induction over n‚àà‚Ñï.
This means that Z n+1,Œõ is supported on the diagonal, and is hence local.
Second we need to show that limŒõ‚Üí‚àûK n+1,Œõ=0:
Inserting this for the first summand in (6) shows that limŒõ‚Üí‚àûK n+1,Œõ=0.
That this is the case is the statement of this prop..
This is similar to a group of UV-cutoff scale-transformations.

Bishop's style was extended to constructive algebra by his disciple Fred Richman.
However, neither of these statements is really true.
First of all, Bishop accepted the principle of countable choice.
(Regarding countable choice see also Richman.)
(See Bishop set.)
Bishop: ‚Äúchoice is implied by the very meaning of existence‚Äù.
(Other possible formalizations of Bishop‚Äôs mathematics use Feferman‚Äôs explicit mathematics or NuPrl.
In particular, since this is true for ‚Ñï, countable choice holds.
Semantically, this can be described as working in a first-order hyperdoctrine.
However, there is some confusion about this definition diagnosed by Waaldijk.
There is a similar problem with the notion of locally compact space.
In particular, see localic completion and the references below.
This approach is pushed even further in continuous truth.
These are not unlike Bishop‚Äôs basic ‚Äúoperations‚Äù.

Class theories are usually formulated in the language of logic over type theory.
It is instead a defined notion from the primitive notion of class.
Thus, we have (x‚à™ iy)(c)=(x‚äóy)(Œî i(c)).
A superspacetime is then a supermanifold locally modeled on super Minkowski spacetime.
This is what is mostly called ‚Äúsuperspace‚Äù in the physics literature.
(These are controled by the Fano plane, shown on the right.)
In physics this is called the Majorana spinor construction.
This we discuss in Real spinors as Majorana spinors
This we discuss in Real spinors via Real alternative division algebras.
This we consider in Spacetime supersymmetry
We write sLieAlg for the resulting category of super Lie algebras.
These may be called the ‚Äúabelian‚Äù super Lie algebras.
We now make explicit structure involved in super-extensions of Lie algebras:
This yields the claimed structure.
This is exactly the claimed ùî§-equivariance of the pairing.
These we introduce and discuss now in Real spin representations.
These are the standard supersymmetry algebras in the physics literature.
Hence we get an ‚Äúexotic‚Äù super-extension of the Poincar√© Lie algebra.
One may appeal to the Haag-≈Åopusza≈Ñski-Sohnius theorem.
There are different ways to get hold of real spin representations.
In physics this is called the Majorana spinor construction.

This is the Lorentz group in dimension d.
This is the canonical action of the Lorentzian special orthogonal Lie algebra ùî∞ùî¨(d‚àí1,1).
Hence exp(‚àíŒ±2Œì ab)v^exp(Œ±2Œì ab)=exp(12[Œì ab,‚àí])(v^) is the rotation action as claimed.
This kernel reflects the ambiguity from remark .
We are interested in spin representations on real vector spaces.
All vector spaces in the following are taken to be finite dimensional vector spaces.
Let V be a complex vector space.
The basic such are called the Dirac representations.
These representations are called the Dirac representations, their elements are called Dirac spinors.
Then a Clifford representation in dimension d=2ŒΩ+1 is given by taking
Let a,b‚àà{1,‚ãØ,d‚àí1} be spacelike and distinct indices.
This is called the chirality operator.
These V ¬± are called the two Weyl representations of Spin(d‚àí1,1).
This operation is called Dirac conjugation.
Either C (¬±) is called the charge conjugation matrix.
, see van Proeyen 99, table 1, Laenen, table E.3).
Proposition For d‚àà{4,8,9,10,11}, let V=‚ÑÇ ŒΩ as above.
First let a,b both be spatial.
That global sign cancels since we pass through two Gamma matrices.
This is called the Majorana representation inside the Dirac representation (if it exists).
This is same kind of computation as in the proof prop. .
Finally the last statement follows from this by prop. .
Of course we may combine the condition Majorana and Weyl conditions on spinors:
Hence the even dimensions among these are d‚àà{4,8,10}.
It follows that J commutes with Œì d precisely if it commutes with œµ.
This is the case for d=10=2‚ãÖ5, but not for d=8=2‚ãÖ4 neither for d=4=2‚ãÖ2.
This is the super Poincar√© Lie algebra, to which we come below.
The equivariance follows exactly as in the proof of prop. .
so this sign cancels against the sign in i *=‚àíi.
The equivariance follows as in the proof of prop. .
By prop. the Dirac representation in d=11 has complex dimension 2 10/2=2 5=32.
This representation often just called ‚Äú32‚Äù.
This is the local model space for super spacetimes in 11-dimensional supergravity.
Hence as real/Majorana Spin(9,1)-representations there is a direct sum decomposition 32‚âÉ16‚äï16¬Ø.
Notice that this is Majorana-Weyl.
This is the case by prop. .
The other two cases are directly analogous.
(Here and in the following we are using the nation from remark .)
We follow the streamlined discussion in Baez-Huerta 09 and Baez-Huerta 10.
This operation makes ùïÇ into a star algebra.
Hence the conjugation operation makes ùïÇ a real normed division algebra.
This implies the second statement by linearity.
It only remains to see that the associator of the octonions is skew-symmetric.
By linearity it is sufficient to check this on generators.
This happens in the proof of prop. below.

The dependent sum is a universal construction in category theory.

Every set X can be totally ordered.

Now put the lexicographic order on the set of pairs F‚Ä≤={(n,x):n‚àà‚Ñï,x‚ààF n}.
A child of e is such a descendant with m=n+1.

It is the one-step categorification of the concept of a category.
The term 2-category implicitly refers to a globular structure.
By contrast, double categories are based on cubes instead.
Notice that double category is another term for 2-fold category.
Similarly, a strict 2-groupoid is a groupoid enriched over groupoids.
It is also equivalent to the category of (strict) double groupoids with connections.
The functor comp gives us an operation of horizontal composition on 2-cells.
The construction in the last axiom is the horizontal composite Œ∏‚àòŒ∑:h‚àòf‚Üíi‚àòg.
This results in fewer, but more complicated, axioms.
Composition within the category K(a,b) corresponds to vertical composition.
This is to be contrasted with a weak 2-category called a bicategory.
Indeed, horizontal composition is often called the Godement product.
A few years after that, B√©nabou introduced the notion of bicategory.

This inclusion of smooth manifolds into locally ringed spaces is fully faithful.

The connection between the two pictures is then given by ‚ü®A‚ãÖU(t)‚ü© œà=‚ü®A‚ü© U(t)*œà.
However, this is unnecessary for the connection between the two pictures.
In contrast, the Schr√∂dinger picture cannot be so treated.
Thus the Schr√∂dinger picture exists but is frame dependent.
The attempt to pretend it did leads to the problems mentioned in Dirac‚Äôs paper.

The study of transvections is often more complicated in the characteristic 2 case.
The notion is due to Carboni and Walters.
The tensor product ‚äó behaves like the ordinary product of relations.
We record a few consequences of this notion.
The other triangular equation uses the dual Frobenius equation.
In this way, a bicategory of relations becomes a ‚Ä†-compact Pos-enriched category.
So f preserves comultiplication strictly.
A similar argument shows f preserves the counit strictly.
The proof is much more perspicuous if we use string diagrams.
But the key steps are given in two strings of equalities and inequalities.
The first gives a counit for f‚ä£f op, and the second gives a unit.
Bicategories of relations B satisfy a Beck-Chevalley condition, as follows.
According to the results at free cartesian category, Prod(B 0) is finitely complete.
See Brady-Trimble for further details.
Existential quantification is interpreted by precomposing with right adjoints œÄ(f) *.
The Beck-Chevalley condition exerts compatibility between quantification and pullback/substitution functors.
Any bicategory of relations is an allegory.
Thus 1 is a unit.
In the other direction, suppose A is a unitary pretabular allegory.
Indeed, a bicategory of relations is equivalent to a unitary pretabular allegory.

This is the topic of the following chapters Free quantum fields and Scattering.
The following spells out an argument to this effect.
This Lie bracket is what controls dynamics in classical mechanics.
Something to take notice of here is the infinitesimal nature of the Poisson bracket.
There may be different global Lie group objects with the same Lie algebra.
From here the story continues.
It is called the story of geometric quantization.
We close this motivation section here by some brief outlook.
These are the actual wavefunctions of quantum mechanics, hence the quantum states.
The concept of quantization is induced by this local phase space-structure.
(Other choices are possible, notably Œ∏=pdq).
These are also called the leaves of a real polarization of the phase space.
This establishes a linear isomorphism between polarized smooth functions and wave functions.
Hence under the identification (5) we have q^œà=qœàAAAAp^œà=i‚àÇ‚àÇqœà.
This is called the Schr√∂dinger representation of the canonical commutation relation (6).
With this the statement follows by example .
(extending quantization beyond regular polynomial observables)
But in general it is necessary to consider also non-linear polynomial local observables.
We discuss this in detail in the chapter Free quantum fields.
This we discuss in the chapters Scattering and Quantum observables.
This concludes our discussion of some basic concepts of quantization.
There is good motivation for sheaves, cohomology and higher stacks.
Let Set be the category of sets.
Geometric embeddings x:Sh(*)‚Üí‚ÜêSh(C) are called points of Sh(C).

So the model structures we shall encounter are plausible guesses.
This fully general notion we introduce now.
This is indeed itself an (‚àû,1)-category (HTT, prop 1.2.7.3).
is the homotopy category of an (‚àû,1)-category.
It is often convenient to present (‚àû,1)-categories by 1-categorical models.
Now we generalize the above from sheaves to (‚àû,1)-sheaves also known as ‚àû-stacks.
The (‚àû,1)-category of (‚àû,1)-presheaves on C is PSh ‚àû(C):=[C op,‚àûGrpd]=Func(C op,‚àûGrpd).
(see also HTT, prop 6.5.2.14).
Notice that this does not yet say that the localization is left exact .

These are called the edge homomorphisms.

Lambda takes an antivariable and a term that may use the corresponding variable.
This turns an antivariable x introduced by lambda into the term x. A:T√óT‚ÜíT.
This takes f and g and produces f(g).

The string diagrams corresponding to this category are called sharing graphs.

Let C=‚Ñ§Mod‚âÉ Ab be the abelian category of abelian groups.
This follows for instance using Baer's criterion, prop. .
The additive group underlying any vector space is injective.
The quotient of any injective group by any other group is injective.
Not injective in Ab is for instance the cyclic group ‚Ñ§/n‚Ñ§ for n>1.
Also one can define various notions of internally injective objects.
The functor [‚àí,I]:‚Ñ∞ op‚Üí‚Ñ∞ maps monomorphisms in ‚Ñ∞ to epimorphisms.
Details are in (Harting, Theorem 1.1).
Proposition Let ‚Ñ∞ be the topos of sheaves over a locale.
Conversely, let I be an internally injective object.
We want to show that there exists an extension Y‚ÜíI of k along m.
To this end, consider the sheaf F‚âî{k‚Ä≤:‚Ñãom(Y,I)|k‚Ä≤‚àòm=k}.
Condition 1. then refers to the functor [‚àí,X]:Ab(‚Ñ∞) op‚ÜíAb(‚Ñ∞).
In the above two cases, this refers to injectivity with respect to monomorphisms.
(Such spaces are usually called, perhaps confusingly, injective spaces.)
With this the statement follows via adjunction isomorphism Hom ùíú(‚àí,R(I))‚âÉHom ‚Ñ¨(L(‚àí),I).
Let ùíû, ùíü be categories and L‚ä£R:ùíü‚Üíùíû be an adjunction.
If L maps monos to monos, then R maps injectives to injectives.
Accordingly it embeds into a quotient AÀú of a direct sum of copies of ‚Ñö.
Then if ‚Ñ¨ has enough injectives, also ùíú has enough injectives.
The first point is the statement of lemma .
In particular if the axiom of choice holds, then RMod has enough injectives.
Since it has a left adjoint, it is exact.
Thus the statement follows via lemma from prop. .
The result is a (p,q)-shuffle.

This is smooth (see smooth maps of mapping spaces?).
Providing M has enough diffeomorphisms, this is the projection of a fibre bundle.
The remark about ‚Äúenough diffeomorphisms‚Äù is the key to proving this.
So we need to drag the rest of Œ≤ along with Œ≤(p).

A flag is complete if dimV i=i for each i‚àà{0,‚Ä¶,n}.

For p=2 the first is the Klein 4-group.
This is equivalently the cyclic group ‚Ñ§/p 1p 2‚Ñ§‚âÉ‚Ñ§/p 1‚Ñ§‚äï‚Ñ§/p 2‚Ñ§.
The isomorphism is given by sending 1 to (p 2,p 1).
The latter is the cyclic group of order p 1 2p 2.
The corresponding p-primary group is ‚®Åi=1q‚Ñ§/p k i‚Ñ§.
Here the only entry that needs further explanation is the one for k=0.

Here we first introduce stepwise the ingredients that go into the proof.
, define a group G√ó cA‚ààGrp as follows.
Hence G√ó cA is indeed a group.
Assume the axiom of choice in the ambient foundations.
indeed yields a 2-cocycle in group cohomology.
Here it is sufficient to observe that for every term also the inverse term appears.
Let [c]‚ààH Grp 2(G,A).
This shows that Extr‚àòRec=id and in particular that Rec is a surjection.
But the ordinary kernel of B(A‚ÜíG^)‚ÜíB(A‚Üí1)=B 2A is manifestly BG^, and so on.
Hence we may speak of symmetric group cohomology classes in degree 2.
This is sometimes called Schreier‚Äôs theory of nonabelian group extensions.
In fact œï:G‚ÜíInn(G)‚äÇAut(K) is a homomorphism of groups.
Thus we obtain a well-defined map œï *:G/K‚ÜíAut(K)/Int(K).
Unlike œï, the map œà is not a homomorphism of groups.
We attempt to reconstruct G from the knowledge of œà and K.
By means of that bijection, B√óK inherits the group structure from G.
Let us figure out the multiplication rule on B√óK.
This formula clearly defines a function œá:B√óB‚ÜíK.
Thus we obtain the relation (5)œà(a)œà(b)=œà(ab)Ad K(œá(a,b))
Let B and K be two groups.
Then K is a right B-module through œà(‚àí) ‚àí1.
This was useful to find the cocycle condition correctly.
Now the general associativity should be a similar calculation with general elements.
Using (4) and (5) it can be done.
We define the set-theoretic maps œÉ‚Ä≤,œá‚Ä≤ and œà‚Ä≤ as follows.
The last line is true by (4).
The map œÉ:B‚ÜíG, B‚àãb‚Ü¶(1 K,b)‚ààK√óB, splits the sequence.
An extension (1) is Abelian iff K is Abelian.
We say that the extension (1) is Abelian iff G is Abelian.
We know that œµ| K:i(k)‚Ü¶œµi‚Ä≤(k), for all k‚ààK.
By (5) these maps are actually homomorphisms (unlike e.g.œà).
Let us choose some h so that Ad K‚àòh is interpretable as a genuine composition.
Two elements of K generate the same automorphism iff they differ by a central element.
Choose two different h‚Ä≤,h:B√óB‚ÜíK such that Ad K(h‚Ä≤)=Ad K(h).
Any f:B√óB‚ÜíZ(K) such that h‚Ä≤=hf will not change the inner automorphism.
Thus any central 3-coboundary df can be obtained by changing a choice of h.
More on this is at group cohomology nonabelian group cohomology.
And indeed by definition every short exact sequence defines an extension.
A theory for central 2-group extensions is here:
See also references to Dedecker listed here.
(In fact there are many more than mentioned in that introduction.)

This implication means that the shear map is injective.
In the other direction, assume that the shear map is injective.
But then G-equivariance implies that œï(y)=œï(g*x)=g*œï(x)=g*x=y.
For example, the species of linear orders is flat.
The suggestion to rephrase the definition in terms of bisites came from Mike Shulman.
An isomorphism is an invertible morphism, hence a morphism with an inverse morphism.
But beware that two objects may be isomorphic by more than one isomorphism.
Frequently the particular choice of isomorphism matters.
We must so understand it.
And let us not forget that these exceptions are pernicious, for they conceal laws.
The physicists also do it just the same way.
Today we would say that they were looking right in the face of isomorphic groups.
An automorphism is an isomorphism from one object to itself.
It is immediate that isomorphisms satisfy the two-out-of-three property.
Thus, being isomorphic is an equivalence relation on objects.
The equivalence classes form the fundamental 0-groupoid of the category in question.
A groupoid is precisely a category in which every morphism is an isomorphism.
Therefore, for any a,b:A the type a‚âÖb is a set.
Every morphism in a groupoid is an isomorphism.
Idea A scheme is reduced if it has no ‚Äúpurely infinitesimal directions‚Äù.

The following idea or observation or sentiment has been expressed independently by many authors.
Diverse conclusions have been drawn from this.
In type-I computability the computable functions are partial recursive functions
A similar sentiment is voiced by Geroch and Hartle:
This concept of type-II computability is arguably closer to actual practice in physics.
This point is made in (Weihrauch-Zhong 02) for the wave equation.
A similar conclusion is reached by Baez.

Monoidal (‚àû,1)-categories form an (‚àû,2)-category, Mon(‚àû,1)Cat.
There are various ways to state the monoidal structure.
One is in terms of fibrations over the simplex category.
This is the approach taken in Jacob Lurie, Noncommutative algebra (arXiv)
Another is in terms of (‚àû,1)-operads (see there).
This approach has been taken in (Francis).
Alternatively, one can read pages 5 and 6 of LurieNonCom cited below.
In any case, this motivates the following definition.
Here Œî is the simplex category and N(Œî) its nerve.
Let ùí™ ‚äó be an (‚àû,1)-operad.
This is (Lurie, def. 2.1.2.13).
For ùí™ = Comm, an ùí™-monoidal (‚àû,1)-category is a symmetric monoidal (‚àû,1)-category.
The second statement is example 2.3.8 in EnAction.

Algebraic number theory studies algebraic numbers, number fields and related algebraic structures.
An algebraic integer is a root of a monic polynomial with integer coefficients.
Usually one considers algebraic number fields over rational numbers.
A subtopos is dense if it contains the initial object ‚àÖ of the ambient topos.
Let i:‚Ñ∞ j‚Ü™‚Ñ∞ be a subtopos with corresponding Lawvere-Tierney topology j.
‚àÖ is a j-sheaf.
A topology j satisfying these conditions is also called dense.
Another way to say this is that ‚àÖ is preserved by i *.
An even more comprehensive list can be found in (Caramello 2012, p.9).
Of course, the composition k‚àòj of dense inclusions j,k is again dense.
When j is dense, then i and k are dense as well.
In other words, the intersection of two dense subtoposes is still dense!
For any topos ‚Ñ∞, its double negation topology gives the smallest dense subtopos.
Proposition Sh ¬¨¬¨(‚Ñ∞)‚Ü™‚Ñ∞ is the smallest dense subtopos.
In fact, dense topologies are characterized by their relation to ¬¨¬¨:
Here the first inclusion exhibits a dense subtopos and the second a closed subtopos.
The above terminology suggests to view a dense subtopos as one with an empty exterior.
Let‚Äôs have a look at some of the details:
Then ‚Ñ∞ is connected as well.
In fact they are Boolean precisely when M is a group.
Hence the j-closure ext(j) of ‚àÖ‚Ü£1 is either ‚àÖ or 1.
Notice that this applies e.g. to well-pointed toposes.
In particular, this applies to ‚àÖ‚Ü£1, since 1 is always a sheaf.
Whence ‚àÖ is a j-sheaf and we see that persistent localizations are dense.
This includes e.g. ‚Äòquintessential localizations‚Äô aka quality types.
This observation is due to Johnstone (1996).
Then level n+1 is the Aufhebung of n starting from ‚àÖ‚ä£* at level 0.
A space is sequentially Cauchy-complete if every Cauchy sequence converges.
A space is topologically complete if its underlying topological space is completely metrizable.
There are various other notions related to this.
But it works for most natural categories of spaces.
This is useful to have even if X is already complete.
A compact space is necessarily complete.
A space is called precompact if its completion is compact.
Every complete metric space is a Baire space.
See MathOverflow here for some examples.
Accordingly, this becomes the notion of Cauchy-complete category.

A logarithm is a local section of an exponential map.
Suppose c is a complex number.
As exp‚Ä≤=exp, we find that (exp(x)exp(c‚àíx))‚Ä≤=exp(x)exp(c‚àíx)+exp(x)(‚àíexp(c‚àíx))=0.
The initial condition exp(0)=1 then yields exp(x)exp(c‚àíx)=exp(c).
The result follows by setting c=x+y.‚Äù

Similarly one has for all X that C(X,*)=*.
So we reduce the situation to that case.
This is possible because both A and B are assumed to be fibrant.
Therefore this is also a weak equivalence.

This is especially true if we want to add additional structure to our (‚àû,1)-categories.
Thus, there may be an ‚àû-extensionality axiom to be added.
Disjoint sum types may be expected to correspond to coproducts in an (‚àû,1)-category.
The usual notions of quotient type make little sense without extensional identity types.

Predicative mathematics is a way of doing mathematics without allowing impredicative definitions.
The common ground is that both schools reject power sets; other axioms may vary.
Such mathematics may be called weakly predicative.
One sometimes speaks of forbidding function sets instead of power sets.
The converse holds if there is a set Œ© of truth values.
So the classical school of predicativism rejects function sets.
In this school, the sequence above is fine.
Classical predicativists of course accept excluded middle; otherwise they would be constructivists.
Some classical predicativists accept choice operators.
This includes dependent type theories which include choice operators but reject dependent function types.
This is common in type theoretic models of constructive mathematics.
Categorially, we may see these as initial algebras of certain functors on Set.
So what is the category of sets in predicative mathematics?

Now we can state the main two definitions of this section.
Then for all X‚ààùíú there is a natural isomorphism R 0F(X)‚âÉF(X).

But this means that R 0F(X)‚âîker(F(X 0)‚ÜíF(X 1))‚âÉF(X).
By prop. we can choose f ‚Ä¢ and h ‚Ä¢.

Let ùíú,‚Ñ¨ be abelian categories and assume that ùíú has enough injectives.
Let F be an additive functor which is an exact functor.

A special case of both are F-acyclic resolutions.
Let ùíú,‚Ñ¨ be abelian categories and let F:ùíú‚Üí‚Ñ¨ be an additive functor.
Assume that F is left exact.
Assume that F is right exact.
Consider the case that F is left exact.
The other case works dually.
Similarly, the third condition is equivalent to R 1F(A)‚âÉ0.
Let ùíú be an abelian category with enough injectives.

By connectedness of X, this epi factors through one of the summands, say U.
Of course U is not initial; otherwise Y would be initial.
It need not be the case that products of connected objects are connected.
We do have the following partial result, generalizing the case of Top.
Suppose C is a cocomplete ‚àû-extensive category with finite products.
Then a product of finitely many connected objects is itself connected.
In the first place, 1 is connected.
The two coproduct inclusions U‚ÜíU+U are distinct by disjointness of sums.
Since 1 is a separator, there must be a map 1‚ÜíU separating these inclusions.
We then conclude U‚âÖ1, and then V‚âÖ0 by disjointness of sums.
Now let X and Y be connected.
It follows that the codomain X√óY of œï is also connected.

A natural isomorphism is the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù notion of isomorphism between functors.
However, sometimes one encounters functors that are ‚Äúpointwise isomorphic‚Äù but not naturally.
This intuition is in tune with conceiving of naturality as generalized commutatitivity.
Let F,G:C‚ÜíD be functors.
For instance, this seems to be the meaning in Section 1.1 of Strickland.
We touch on this again below, but see here.
Intuitively, there are several reasons that an isomorphism might fail to be natural.
In defining an isomorphism, it may be necessary to make certain arbitrary choices.
Making the unnatural natural
There are several ways to do this:
See for instance this Wikipedia discussion on axioms for triangulated categories.
The use of adjectives like canonical, invariant, functorial, natural is sometimes satirized.
See non-canonical isomorphism for examples of natural isomorphisms that are not canonical.
In particular, these functors do not form an equivalence of categories.
A similar phenomenon occurs with groups and heaps, and with torsors of groups.
But, there is no canonical choice of ordering L.
Species are functors for which unnatural isomorphisms are sometimes discussed.
More generally, unnatural transformations also often occur in homological algebra.

There is a canonical inclusion ‚àÇ e:T/e‚ÜíT in Œ©.
There is then again a canonical inclusion ‚àÇ v:T/v‚ÜíT.
This is called an outer face map.
Let T be a corolla tree, example .
These are called corolla face maps and counted as outer face maps.
Choices of dendroidal inner horn fillers correspond to choices of composites of operations.
A dendrex Œ©[T]‚ÜíX encodes a collection of operations and choices of theor composite in X.
Picking a filler for this inner horn is picking such a choice.
The outer horn fillers have different interpretation.
For more on this see model structure on dendroidal sets.
We discuss now the definition and some basic propoerties of normal monomorphisms.
Compare to boundary of a simplex.
This is unrelated to the notion of normal monomorphism in a context with zero morphisms.
Here are some equivalent characterizations of normality.
This is (CisMoer09, prop 1.5).
For every tree T, the dendroidal set Œ©[T] is normal.
In particular it is closed under these operations.
This is (CisMoer09, prop 1.4).
As any category of presheaves, dSet is a cartesian monoidal category.
This is (CisMoer09, prop 1.9).
Write 0 for the tree consisting of a single edge.
Let Œ©/0 be the over category.
By general properties of Kan extension we have the following
This appears as (Moerdijk-Weiss, prop. 5.3).
This extends to a functor N d:Operad‚ÜídSet.
See for instance (Moerdijk-Weiss, section 4).
This is compatible with the Boardman-Vogt tensor product as defined above:
This appears as (Moerdijk-Weiss, prop. 5.2).
This extends to a functor hcN d:Operad sSet‚ÜídSet.
The category dSet carries the Cisinski-Moerdijk model structure on dendroidal sets.
With this model structure it forms a monoidal model category.
The ring of rational polynomials ‚Ñù(X) is a real reciprocal algebra.
There exists a reciprocal algebra with nonzero zero divisors.
In ZFC Suppose V is a model of ZFC.
First, if X is a transitive set, then so is P(X).
We have thus shown A‚äÇP(X).
That each R(Œ±) is transitive now follows by an easy induction.
We define the rank of x to be that Œ±.
Each ordinal Œ± has rank Œ±.
All sets in the cumulative hierarchy lie somewhere within the V.
The relation x‚àày can then be interpreted as s(x)‚â§y.
One motivation for this notion is given by the following theorem:
This is the celebrated Robertson-Seymour Graph Minor Theorem.
It generalizes the notion of 1-anafunctor.
This is an ‚àû-anafunctor, generalizing the notion of anafunctor.
This is formalized in the following definition: (‚Ä¶)
Here X^‚ÜíX is essentially the hypercover on which the cocycle is defined.
The generalization of this statement to ‚àû-anafunctors is given in (BlohmannZhu).
Rather, one has a third space with morphisms to each of the two spaces.
Of course, not just any third space will do.
The topological set up is as follows.
We find a third space, Z, which has morphisms to both X and Y.
We usually write this in the following way: Z ‚Üí X ‚Üì Y
This setup induces transgression to mapping spaces in the following.
Now we apply the generalised cohomology theory to this diagram.
As it is a cohomology theory, the arrows reverse.
However, under certain special circumstances, cohomology theories admit push-forward maps.
This is described at fiber integration and Pontrjagin-Thom collapse map.
See for instance section 9 of (Borel).
For more on this see Chern-Simons element.
(We use the smash product as we are working with based spaces here.)
We therefore have the diagram: S 1√óLM ‚Üí M ‚Üì LM
In this case, that is differential forms.
In this case we are in the happy circumstance that the lift exists.
Expressed purely in terms of differential forms, the formula doesn‚Äôt change.
This can make the integration step clearer.
To reformulate transgression thus we need to understand tangent vectors on LM.
However, that‚Äôs not all we need.
This is the vector field which assigns to Œ≥‚ààLM the tangent vector Œ≥‚Ä≤‚ààLTM.
Hence, by varying t‚ààS 1, it defines a function S 1‚Üí‚Ñù.
Thus we have a map ‚®Ç k‚àí1T(LM)‚Üí‚Ñù.
Then contracting with S 1 via ‚à´ S 1, only the second term survives.
There is much more to tell in this particular story.
This makes crucial use of the nPOV notion of cohomology, as described there.
Let H= Top ‚âÉ ‚àûGrpd.
This plays a role in the quantization process that yields FQFTs.
For an application see Dijkgraaf-Witten theory.
To the best of my knowledge, this remark is attributable to Ralph Cohen.
The existence of such an entity (due to Peano) came as a surprise.

This is the statement of topological invariance of dimension.
Surjectivity follows from the fact that its restriction g:C‚ÜíI√óI is surjective.

A space X satisfying the stated conditions is called a Peano space.
An example of such a space is the Warsaw circle.

Dialgebras subsume the notion of algebras for an endofunctor and coalgebras for an endofunctor.
Universal dialgebras were originally introduced by Lambek as ‚Äúsubequalizers‚Äù.

The direct summands are the Brown-Peterson spectra.
As a representation of real numbers, this is almost unique.
In this case, the sequence with 0s is generally considered standard.
In classical mathematics, every nonnegative real number may be represented in this way.
The number 0 is represented only by a sequence of all 0s.

Currently, only lambda adds a scope delimiter.

Set theoretically speaking: (Œì‚Ü¶Œì‚Ä≤)U‚âîU‚à™(Œì‚Ä≤‚àñŒì).

Functions take exactly one argument, and have one or more results.
Semantically, the results are tensored (‚äó) together.
Following Shulman, multiple results are accessed using ‚Äúgeneralized Sweedler notation‚Äù.
Using both results is a single use of linear implication elimination.
This is actually the only way to use tensor projections, currently.
When done checking, there‚Äôs generally more stuff in it.
Currently, that would only be tensor projections.
In any case, everything in the new scope must‚Äôve been consumed.
That‚Äôs the nice application rule, for when there‚Äôs one result.
u is the label metavariable.
This labeling idea is from Shulman.
See there for a discussion of the problem.
The premise U d‚à©Œî‚â†‚àÖ implies that U d is nonempty.
Meanwhile, the other rule checks that the same computed usage is empty.
Otherwise it‚Äôs the outermost scope.
(The analogous concept in homological algebra is called a quasi-isomorphism.)
Weak homotopy equivalences are named after homotopy equivalences.
The corresponding notions in homological algebra are quasi-isomorphisms and chain homotopy-equivalences.
The former is usually defined in terms of the latter.
It is not enough to require that each pair of homotopy groups are isomorphic.
And by the properties of covering spaces, all higher homotopy groups are isomorphic.
But these two are not weakly homotopy equivalent.
There are many alternative definitions of weak homotopy equivalences.
The homotopy category of Top with respect to weak homotopy equivalences is Ho(Top) whe.
See also around (Lurie, prop. 6.5.2.1).
The relevant arguments are spelled out in (May, section 9.6).
A variant is called the HELP lemma in (Vogt).
Reflexivity and transitivity are trivially checked.
A counterexample to symmetry is example below.
But we can consider the genuine equivalence relation generated by weak homotopy equivalence:
This collection of data is called the Postnikov tower decomposition of a homotopy type.
A different direction of generalization is the notion of a homotopy equivalence of toposes.
Let S 1‚àà Top denote the ordinary circle and ùïä the pseudocircle.
Write Œ© 0(R/k):=R‚âÉHH 0(R,R).

See this MO post for details.
Again, this works under a certain smoothness property:
This is due to (McCarthy-Manasian 03).
This article concerns the notion of ‚Äúlocal field‚Äù in commutative algebra.
This appears as HTT, def. 5.4.1.3, prop. 5.4.1.2.
The following are equivalent: C is Œ∫-small.
C is a Œ∫-compact object in (‚àû,1)Cat.
This is HTT, prop. 5.4.1.2
The analogous statement holds for ‚àû-groupoids.
For X an ‚àû-groupoid and Œ∫ an uncountable regular cardinal, the following are equivalent
X is presented by a Œ∫-small simplicial set/Kan complex.
X is a Œ∫-compact object in ‚àûGrpd.
This is (HTT, corollary 5.4.1.5).
Notice that this proposition really requires that Œ∫ be uncountable.

Any ordinary Waldhausen category is a Waldhausen (infinity,1)-category.

Then one continues proof and finally arrives at a new theorem not containing b.
Like Set is the canonical base topos, so Rel is the archetypical meros.
Following Kawahara 1995, we define an auxiliary venue for meroi first.
We next highlight specific morphisms within I-categories.
A partial function f:A‚ÜíB (Def. )
is a total function, or function, when id A‚äëf ‚Ä†‚àòf.
We also need the Dedekind formula, which relates any three morphisms between three objects.
We are now ready to define meroi.
Every relation is rational (in the sense of Def. ).
The Dedekind formula (1) holds whenever possible.
There is a terminal object (in the sense of Def. ).
All quotients (in the sense of Def. ) exist.
For all Œ±,A‚ÜíB we have 0‚àòŒ±=Œ±‚àò0=0.
Let (V,‚àá) and (V‚Ä≤,‚àá‚Ä≤) be two complex vector bundles with connection.

For the discussion of ring spectra we pass to symmetric spectra and orthogonal spectra.
(These overlap, pick the one that seems more inviting on first reading.)
In a PCM, we define: x‚â§y:‚áî‚àÉ z.x‚à®z=y.
This is a preorder on any PCM.
Reflexivity is immediate from the Zero axiom, and transitivity follows easily from Associativity.
A generalized effect algebra is partially ordered by ‚â§.
Let x‚à®a=y and y‚à®b=x.
Then x‚à®(a‚à®b)=x=x‚à®0, and so a‚à®b=0 by the Cancellation Law.
Therefore, a=b=0 and so x=y.
An effect algebra is a PCM (E,0,‚à®) with an orthocomplement.
The latter is a unary operation (‚àí) ‚ä•:E‚ÜíE satisfying: Orthocomplement Law.
Then E is a generalized effect algebra since: Cancellation Law.
Define x ‚ä•=1‚äñx for all x. Then: Orthocomplement Law.
x ‚ä• is the unique element such that x‚à®x ‚ä•=1 by definition.
Let E and F be effect algebras.
We write EA for the category of effect algebras and morphisms of effect algebras.
The orthocomplement of x‚àà[0,1] is given by x ‚ä•=1‚àíx.
Hence p(x) can be written as p(x)=œÜ(x)k 1x+(1‚àíœÜ(x))k 2x.
In particular p 1 and p 2 determine each other uniquely.
In general, this is not a lattice.
These first appeared in K√¥pka 92 Chovanec-K√¥pka 95.
Ultimately this determines an isomorphism of categories between D-posets and effect algebras.
Every Boolean algebra is an effect algebra, with a‚ä•b whenever a‚àßb=0.
The orthocomplement is a ‚ä•=¬¨a.
This means that every effect algebra is a canonical colimit of finite Boolean algebras.
This functor can be given explicitly as finding the tests of an effect algebra.
A test is a sequence of orthogonal elements that sum to 1.
We list some of these issues in the following.
See the last item below.
We leave these questions for future work.

The Kan extension computes the best possible approximation:
Compare this with the definition of germs at a stalk.
The smallest n for which this holds is called the height of the hypercover.
Consider the case that X=constX 0 is simplicially constant.
Then the conditions on a morphism Y‚ÜíX to be a hypercover is as follows.
So the condition is that the vertical morphism is a local epi.
We say that U i‚ÜíX is basal.
It is sufficient that all the U i‚ÜíX are monomorphisms.
Examples include the standard open cover-topology on Top.
This is (Dugger-Hollander-Isaksen 02, theorem 8.6).
Let f:Y‚ÜíX be a hypercover.
We may regard this as an object in the overcategory Sh(C)/X.
By the discussion here this is equivalently Sh(C/X).
This is an abelian category.
As such this has a normalized chain complex N ‚Ä¢(f¬Ø).
This is the central theorem in (Dugger-Hollander-Isaksen 02).
But historically it predates the above- theorem.
Locally compact locales are also exactly the exponentiable objects in the category of locales.

A line integral is an integral along a curve.
In particular, we interpret dr‚Üí as meaning r‚Üí‚Ä≤(t)dt.
But this suggests that we should really be looking at differential forms.
Understanding this, we wish to generalise X to any (pseudo)-Riemannian manifold.
Since ds is positive, we can reasonably call it the principal square root of g.
In any case, a line integral along a lightlike curve is zero.
In particular, dz is interpreted as z‚Ä≤(t)dt.
But again, we should really be looking at differential forms.
Then dz is a 1-form, and fdz is a 1-form.
Of course, we should really be looking at differential forms.
Again z is the identity map on ‚ÑÇ, viewed as a 0-form.

As the base case, we take ‚ÑùP ‚àí1 to be the empty type.
TCFTs are therefore a tool for formalizing homological mirror symmetry.
This is ClassTFT, theorem 4.2.11.
Actually it was the unfolded version to be proven first, (Costello 04).
We state it below in the general version given by Jacob Lurie in ClassTFT.
This is ClassTFT, above theorem 4.2.13.

Let C be a symmetric monoidal (‚àû,1)-category.
This is a special case of the general cobordism hypothesis-theorem.
The proof that this yields a TCFT is theorem 4.5.4.)
This is known as Kodeira-Spencer gravity or as BCOV theory.
See in particular lecture 5 (‚Äútopological field theory with cochain values‚Äù).
The classification of TCFTs by Calabi-Yau categories was discussed in
This classification is a precursor of the full cobordism hypothesis-theorem.
In quantum algebra, the partial trace is a generalization of trace.
The partial trace corresponds to partial measurement on a physical system.
The partial trace is generalized by traced monoidal categories.
Let Vec k denote the category of finite dimensional vector spaces over a field k.
Explicitly, the partial trace can also be defined as follows.
Let f:V‚äóW‚ÜíV‚äóW be an endomorphism.
This gives the matrix b k,i.
Considering Vec k as a pivotal category, this diagram is completely rigorous.
To make sure this notation is consistent, we verify
Additionally the closed loop can only be trace.

They generalize quivers (directed graphs), which describe generators of ordinary (1-)categories.
Each type of higher-categorical structure comes with its own notion of computad.
Adjointness is easy to verify using the universal properties of pullbacks and pushouts.
Thus a 1-computad is just a quiver.
These play the role of 2 n and ‚àÇ n above.
We leave the details to the reader.
Moreover, the problem can also be avoided if P is ‚Äúsuitably weak.‚Äù
To define what this means, one considers the ‚Äúslices‚Äù of the operad P.

Then for 0‚â§l‚â§n, the horn inclusion Œõ l[n]‚Ü™Œî[n] is also in W.
Quillen‚Äôs small object argument then implies all the trivial cofibrations are in W.
Thus every trivial Kan fibration is also in W.
this ought to be a Quillen functor, but is it?
We check successively what this means for increasing n: n=0.
Hence that F is a full functor.
Hence that F is a faithful functor.
Alternative simpler proofs were found in Gambino-Sattler-Szumi≈Ço 19.

The (‚àû,1)-topos Smooth‚àûGrpd of all smooth ‚àû-groupoids is a cohesive (‚àû,1)-topos.
It realizes a higher geometry version of differential geometry.
See SynthDiff‚àûGrpd for more on that.
A detailed proof is given at good open cover.

Hence we may find a differentiably good open cover {K j‚Üí‚àê iU i}.
This is then a refinement of the original open cover of X.

This comes with its symmetric monoidal (‚àû,1)-category of ‚àû-modules EMod ‚äó.
First we consider local prequantum field theory.
This is true for simple instances of scalar fields and sigma-model fields.
A field bundle for these is hence a U(1)-n-gerbe.
We consider now H to be a suitable such (‚àû,1)-topos.
This describes a scattering process.
These are of course the operations in the little k-cubes operad.
This is symmetric monoidal by objectwise Cartesian product in H.
Equivalently, they are ‚àû-groups of conserved currents.
Such a diagram defines a local prequantum field theory (topological+boundary+defects).
This theory may have boundaries/branes.

This we come to in the next section.
We now survey the cohomological quantization step.
See (Nuiten 13, section 4).
This we discuss now below.
We realize this now by fiber integration in generalized cohomology.
The statement is discussed explicitly in (Nuiten 13, section 4.1).
First, the basic example to keep in mind is integration in ordinary cohomology.
The shift in degree here seems to somewhat break the simple pattern.
Notice that f * preserves duals, but f ! may not.
Here we survey some examples of cohomological quantization.
See (Nuiten 13, section 5).
The traditional input for quantization is a phase space represented by a symplectic manifold.
This now yields a correspondence in H /BU(1).
So we might be inclined to apply cohomological quantization to this.
This turns out to be the case, indeed.
Its moduli stack of fields is the symplectic groupoid 2dCSFields(X,œÄ).
So far this produces just the space of quantum states.

The obstruction to its existence is the quantum anomaly.
Here we describe technical details of motivic quantization.
The ambient ‚àû-topos and algebra inside Let H be a cohesive (‚àû,1)-topos.
This makes (H /ùîæ,‚äó ùîæ) a monoidal (‚àû,1)-topos.
Under pasting of diagrams this is naturally an (‚àû,n)-category.
We write for short Corr n(H /ùîæ)‚âîCorr(H /ùîæ) ‚ñ° n.
This is a symmetric monoidal (‚àû,n)-category.
This is the local incarnation of the corresponding boundary condition/brane.
This is the (‚àû,1)-category of spaces equipped with (‚àû,1)-line bundles over E.
But one can consider similar constructions Œì for more general ambient (‚àû,1)-toposes H.

This is actually a bifibration.
For an ordinary category, a bifiber of this is just a set.

Then ‚Ñ∞ is an atomic topos.
For the argument see at atomic site.
Atomic toposes decompose as disjoint unions of connected atomic toposes.

Simplicial groups model all ‚àû-groups in ‚àûGrpd.

The definition of a Gorenstein ring spectrum is motivated by the Gorenstein condition for rings.
An (‚àû,1)-presheaf on S is an (‚àû,1)-functor F:S op‚Üí(‚àû,0)Cat.
Various Quillen equivalences between these model structures are constructed in the references.
The model structure for right fibrations of quasicategories is constructed in Higher Topos Theory.
Again, this generalizes the case of modules.
(See here for the details.)
Denote this object by [A,B] T.
However, not all those morphisms are necessarily morphisms of T -algebras.
See here for more information.
We say that H is 0-coherent if it is quasi-compact.
The following generalizes the Deligne completeness theorem from topos theory to (‚àû,1)-topos theory.
Example ‚àûGrpd is coherent and locally coherent.
Hence the fully coherent objects here are the homotopy types with finite homotopy groups.
K is the basic epistemic logic.
This logic is the smallest normal modal logic.
The cochain cohomology of the underlying cochain complex is the Lie algebra cohomology of ùî§.
Here the elements in the nth term in parenthesis are in degree n.
And the CE-construction is functorial.
This means that many constructions involving dg-algebras are secretly about ‚àû-Lie theory.
Of ‚àû-Lie algebroids See ‚àû-Lie algebroid.
So this is an algebraic definition of higher category.
To get weak ‚àû-functors one has to resolve C.
One way to do this is described in (Garner).
A discussion of weak œâ-functors between Batanin œâ-categories is in
An application of Batanin weak œâ-groupoids to homotopy type theory appears in
For a generalization see J-orthogonal matrix.
This is consequence of Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization.
The notion is most important in enriched category theory.
Absolute colimits of this sort are also called Cauchy colimits.
Both types of absolute colimits admit pleasant characterizations.
The third clearly follows from the second.
Also, the first half of the fourth condition by itself characterizes absolute weak colimits.
Then F defines a functor I‚ÜíB; call it F‚Ä≤.
Note that A is also the colimit of F‚Ä≤ in B.
More generally (of course), absolute coequalizers are absolute.
absolute pushouts appear in elegant Reedy categories.
We can also say something about non-examples.
Initial objects (in Set-enriched categories) are never absolute.
Similarly, coproducts in Set-enriched categories are never absolute.
In enriched category theory there can be more types of absolute colimits.
in Lawvere metric spaces, limits of Cauchy sequences are absolute.
This is the origin of the name ‚ÄúCauchy colimit.‚Äù
in posets, suprema of subsets with a greatest element are absolute.
New kinds of absolute (co)limits also arise in higher category theory.
This generalises absoluteness, taking K to be the identity functor.
A locale L is positive if the top open sublocale L‚ààùí™(L) is positive.
It has multiple interpretations in higher category theory.
Of special interest is the case where N=A.
More generally, this computes the cotangent complex of the ‚àû-algebra ùí™(X).
Then for X an ùí™-perfect object we have K‚ãÖùí™(X)‚âÉùí™(X K).
The following definition formalizes large classes of ùí™-perfect objects given by representables.
Let T be an (‚àû,1)-algebraic theory and TAlg ‚àû its (‚àû,1)-category of ‚àû-algebras.
Take H:=Sh(C) the (‚àû,1)-category of (‚àû,1)-sheaves on C.
This is an (‚àû,1)-topos for derived geometry modeled on TAlg ‚àû.
Write C‚Ü™H for the (‚àû,1)-Yoneda embedding.
This object we call the Hochschild homology complex of ùí™X.
Generally for higher order Hochschild homology we have ùí™(X K)‚âÉK‚ãÖùí™(X)‚âÉlim ‚Üí Kùí™(X)‚ààTAlg ‚àû.
By assumption C is closed under limits in TAlg ‚àû op.
is called the topological chiral homology of X.
For more details see (GinotTradlerZeinalian).
This is discussed in the section ‚àû-tensoring ‚Äì models.
But the directions of the face maps are opposite.
We recall the grading situation from function algebras on ‚àû-stacks.
This section focuses on exposition.
Let A‚ààCAlg k be a commutative associative algebra over a commutative ring k.
We describe now in detail what this simplicial circle algebra looks like.
To be very explicit, we recall and demonstrate the following elementary fact.
follows from the fact that f and g are
Notice that for all this it is crucial that we are working with commutative algebras.
The three face maps from degree 3 to degree 2 are more interesting.
Therefore we have manifestly Œ© K 1(A)‚âÉC 1(A,A)/im(‚àÇ).
So passage to the normalized chains imposes the condition d1=0.
A functor between delooping groupoids BG‚ÜíBH is precisely a group homomorphism G‚ÜíH.
This sends Œ∑:*‚Ü¶(*‚Üí1*).
Let N be an A-bimodule.
The first statement is discussed at (‚àû,1)-algebraic theory and homotopy T-algebra.
The second statement is discussed at monoidal Dold-Kan correspondence.
Let H‚âîSh (‚àû,1)(C) be the (‚àû,1)-sheaf (‚àû,1)-topos over C.
The derived loop space instead has rich interesting structure.
This localized model structure we write [T,sSet] inj,prod.
This is usually discussed as a chain complex in the category of ùí™(X)-modules.
This is clearly degreewise a monomorphism, hence is a monomorphism.
This morphism of chain complexes is an isomorphism in homology.
The entire construction proceeds entirely at the underlying simplicial sets of our simplicial algebras.
That fibrant replacement equips the Hochschild chain complex with the structure of an ‚àû-algebra.
Fix a field k of characteristic 0.
We sketch the proof in terms of the above derived loop space technology.
Consider as before the categorical circle S 1 as the corresponding constant ‚àû-stack in H.
We describe the function ‚àû-algebra on S 1.
This point is amplified in (Ben-ZivNadler).
Corollary We have that [S 1,SpecA]:U‚Ü¶cdgAlg k(A,ùí™(U)‚äïùí™(U)[‚àí1]).
We describe various aspects of this.
See (Tamarkin-Tsygan) and see at Kontsevich formality for more.
This equivalence enters the construction of formal deformation quantization of Poisson manifolds.
Let A be an associative algebra over k.
Write Œ© 0(R/k):=R‚âÉHH 0(R,R).
The next statement is known as the Deligne conjecture.
This was observed in (Ben-ZviFrancisNadler, corollary 6.8).
This proved Deligne‚Äôs conjecture.
Various authors later further refined this result.
A summary of this history can be found in (Hess).
The function algebra on LConstX is the cosimplicial algebra of singular cochains on X.
This has maybe been first made explicit by Bertrand To√´n.
Details are at function algebras on ‚àû-stacks.
Apply the central identification ùí™‚Ñí(LConstX)‚âÉS 1‚ãÖùí™(LConstX).
Then use by the above remark that ùí™LConstLX is singular cochains on LX.
We now review the results in the literature on this point.
Write C ‚Ä¢(X) for the dg-algebra of cochains for singular cohomology of X.
This is due to (FelixThomasVigue-Poirrier, section 7)).
This is due to (Jones).
This is (Menichi, theorem 3).
Passing to the cyclically invariant (co)chains yields cyclic (co)homology.
This says that f must be a Hochschild cocycle f‚ààHH 2(R,N).
See for instance Weibel, theorem 9.3.1. Hochschild cohomology and deformations
So in particular such extensions are given by Hochschild cocycles f‚ààHH 2(R,R).

Of course this is just the defining free property.
is the strict model structure on topological sequential spectra.
The concept of free spectrum is a generalization of that of suspension spectrum.
This is called the free structured spectrum-functor.
The second follows from similar yoga, see the formula at Day convolution ‚Äì Modules.
Explicitly, the free spectra according to def. , look as follows:
To this end, first consider the following general existence statement.
With this the statement follows by the Yoneda lemma.
Now we say explicitly what these maps are:
Consider the case Dia=Seq and n=0.
All other cases work analogously.
It remains to see that this is the (Œ£‚ä£Œ©)-adjunct of œÉ 0 X.
and this immediately gives that Œª n is an isomorphism on stable homotopy groups.
Hence its smash product with S q is (2q‚àín‚àí1)-connected.
The key here is the fast growth of the connectivity with q.
Hence Œ£ nŒª n is a stable weak homotopy equivalence and therefore so is Œª n.
Since this is natural in Z, the Yoneda lemma implies the claim.
To that end we need the following little preliminary.
are stable equivalences according to def. .
We need to in addition resolve them by suitable cofibrations:
With this the statement follows by the proof of this theorem.
Therefore the fiber F of f is its homotopy fiber in the strict model structure.
Then let E be any Omega-spectrum.
We are to conclude that hence F‚Üí* is a stable equivalence.
Therefore lemma implies that p is a strict acyclic fibration.
follows from lemma and the small object argument.
We break up this statement below as prop. and prop. .
The functor R ‚àû from def. has the following properties.
Let E be an Omega-spectrum.
This naturality now implies a retraction of morphisms i
This means by definition that f is a stable equivalence.
This implies that so are their pushout products k n‚ñ°i.
This completes the proof of theorem .
We give the proof below, after a few preliminaries.
By lemma the stable fibrations are equivalently the K-injective morphisms.
Therefore the statement follows with prop. .
Lemma Let Y‚ààùïä diaMod stable be cofibrant.
That follows with a laborious argument using the above lemmas (‚Ä¶).
In this form the statement is also known as Yoneda reduction.
is essentially dual to the proof of the next prop. .
This shows the claim at the level of the underlying sets.
All examples are at the end of this section, starting with example below.
A monoid in (Ab,‚äó ‚Ñ§,‚Ñ§) (def. ) is equivalently a ring.
The mapping simplex M(œï) of œï is defined by:
See for instance at Ext-functor for examples.
The dual notion is that of injective presentation.
In abelian categories Let ùíú be an abelian category.
For more survey and motivation see at vector bundle.
Here we discuss the details of the general concept in topology.
See also differentiable vector bundle and algebraic vector bundle.
vector space means finite dimensional vector space.
It follows that n‚àà‚Ñï is constant on connected components.
Let X be a topological space.
In this case one says that the vector bundle has rank n.
This category usually denoted Vect(X).
We write Vect(X) /‚àº for the set of isomorphism classes of this category.
Let k and n be as in def. .
Then: For k=‚Ñù one speaks of real vector bundles.
For k=‚ÑÇ one speaks of complex vector bundles.
This is called the trivial vector bundle of rank n over X.
A vector bundle for which a trivialization exists is called trivializable.
(That these topologies coincide is the statement of this prop..
These are called the transition functions for the given local trivialization.
These functions satisfy a special property:
Let X be a topological space.
Therefore E(c)‚ÜíX is a topological vector bundle (def. ).
We say it is the topological vector bundle glued from the transition functions.
Remark (bundle glued from Cech cocycle is a coequalizer)
It is clear that this continuous function is a bijection.
So let O be an subset in the quotient space which is open.
Say that two Cech cocycles are cohomologous if there exists a coboundary between them.
By def. this exhibits the required coboundary.
(Cech cohomology) Let X be a topological space.
Let X be a topological space.
Hence this is the required vector bundle isomorphism.
Accordingly by example these functions define a vector bundle.
This is called the clutching construction of vector bundles over n-spheres.
What we need to show is that this is a continuous function.
Also the f i are fiberwise invertible, hence are continuous bijections.
write the f i a little.
(fiberwise linearly independent sections trivialize a vector bundle)
, then E is trivializable (example ).
We discuss properties of the direct sum of vector bundles for topological vector bundles.
Hence this is an injection of E into a trivial vector bundle.
With this the statement follows by prop. .
This result is apparently due to Steenrod, see Theorem 11.4 in Steenrod.
The proof below follows Hatcher, theorem 1.6.
For each point x‚ààX this induces a cover of {x}√ó[0,1].
Let X be a paracompact Hausdorff space.
Such an open subset is (U‚à©œà n ‚àí1(V))√ó[0,1].
Let E i‚Üíp iX be two topological vector bundles over X, i‚àà{1,2}.
Here the last step uses the nature of the partition of unity.
Let E‚Ä≤‚âîE/‚àº be the corresponding quotient topological space.
Hence it only remains to see that E‚Ä≤‚ü∂p‚Ä≤X/A is a vector bundle.
The fiberwise linearity is clear, we need to show that it is locally trivializable.
But such a U does indeed exist by lemma .
This says that q * is surjective.
Finally, it is clear that it is injective.
There is a bijective correspondence between kernel functors and uniform filters of ideals in R.
For example with H= Smooth‚àûGrpd the objects of TSmth‚àûGrpd are smooth parametrized spectra.

This is the quotient bigebra.
Composition of such spheres is by gluing along punctures.
In that case we talk about a conformal vertex algebra.
There is a notion of a module over a vertex algebra.
Then it follows that there are only finitely many nonisomorphic simple A-modules.

Let G‚ààGrp(H) be an ‚àû-group equipped with an ‚àû-action œÅ on V.
For V‚ààH, write Aut(V)‚ààGrp(H) for the internal automorphism ‚àû-group of V.
This comes with a canonical action on V.
This is discussed in (NSS, section I 4.1).
Under this presentation we have: Proposition
Compare universal principal ‚àû-bundle.
See there for more details.
Early work on associated ‚àû-bundles takes place in the (‚àû,1)-topos ‚àûGrpd ‚âÉ Top.
See the references at univalence for more on this.
We also assume identity types, the sharp modality, and the flat modality.
Another consequence is that the shape of R is contractible.
But this is true from the third introduction rule for  ÉR.
Thus, R is compact connected if ùüö is discrete.
continuum cohesionlocalization at a Hausdorff space Rùüö is discrete.
metric continuum cohesionlocalization at a metric space Rùüö is discrete.

(To emphasise this last change, we may call such functions almost measurable.)

More generally one may consider spaces of functions on any set.
The sequences spaces are basic examples of topological vector spaces.
We equip l 1 with the l 1-norm ‚Äña‚Äñ 1‚âî‚àë k|a k|.
This is a Banach space.
We equip l ‚àû with the supremum norm: ‚Äña‚Äñ ‚àû‚âîsup k|a k|.
This is also a Banach space.
This is a locally convex space.
We equip c 0 with the supremum norm.
This is also a locally convex space, in fact a Banach space.
We also equip c ‚àû with the supremum norm.
This is also a Banach space.
c b is the space of absolutely bounded sequences: sup k|a k|<‚àû.
We equip c b with the supremum norm too.
This is yet another Banach space.
(But they generalise differently.)
Finally, N K is the space of all sequences.
These properties all use the version of c ‚àû with extra property.
The various direct sums of Banach spaces follow the sequence spaces l p for 1‚â§p‚â§‚àû.
generalise to the Lebesgue spaces L p on arbitrary measure spaces.
With these caveats, l p works just fine for 0<p<‚àû.
A nonzero module M is uniform iff its injective envelope E(M) is indecomposable.
Let Œ∫ be a regular cardinal.
A (‚àû,1)-category ùíû is Œ∫-accessible if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions:
The notion of accessibility is mostly interesting for large (‚àû,1)-categories.
For the first few this is HTT, prop. 5.4.2.2.
So morphisms are the accessible (‚àû,1)-functors that also preserves compact objects.
This is HTT, def. 5.4.2.16.
This is HTT section 5.4.4, 5.4.5 and 5.4.6.
The (‚àû,1)-pullback of accessible (‚àû,1)-categories in (‚àû,1)Cat is again accessible.
This is HTT, section 5.4.6.
This is HTT, proposition 5.4.7.3.

Notice that both S 0 and S 1 are the trivial group.
This gives an evident forgetful functor U:VOperad‚ÜíVColl.

In a monoidal category See monoid in a monoidal category.
But taking this too literally may create conflicts in notation.
This realizes every monoid as a monoid of endomorphisms.
For more on this see also group.
The notion of associative monoids discussed above are controled by the associative operad.
A monoid in which every element has an inverse is a group.
Without this notation we cannot even write down the universal G-bundle!
Both these are very important.
Or take an abelian group A and a codomain like 2Vect.
All of these concepts are different, and useful.
The first one is an object in the group 3-algebra of A.
We have notation to distinguish this, and we should use it.
The integer d is called the degree of the Weierstrass polynomial.
The graph of any symplectomorphism induces a Lagragian correspondence.
Further assuming this we have for composition that L(Y 01‚àòY 12)=L(Y 01)‚àòL(Y 12).
We can see that JA is simply the free monoid on A.
The higher inductive type is recursive which can make it difficult to study.
This change has some important consequences.
This simply makes a direct correspondence between the algebra of A and the geometric logic.
The classifying topos is the topos of sheaves over A.
The frame is a presentation-independent representation of the theory.
It can be recovered from the theory as the Lindenbaum algebra of formulae modulo equivalence.
There are various flavours of this.
Its propositional symbols are œï a for each a‚ààB.
The models are known as formal points.
The traditional way of doing topology using points may be called pointwise topology.
In other words, geometric logic is not necessarily complete.
Thus continuity becomes a logical issue, of geometricity.
Further details and references are in Vickers 2007 and 2014.
Joyal and Tierney proved their result for internal frames.
This is not the case for frames - the frame structure is not geometric.
(Formal topology arose out of a desire to work predicatively.)
This is best understood in terms of bundles over X.
As a discrete coreflection it must also have a bundle map f from q to p.
Suppose x‚äëx‚Ä≤ are two points of X that are related by the specialization order.
Then there is a corresponding fibre map q ‚àí1(x)‚Üíq ‚àí1(x‚Ä≤).
As an example, take X to be the Sierpinski space ùïä.
Its sheaves are functions - the fibre maps Z ‚ä•‚ÜíZ ‚ä§.
Now consider the bundle p:1‚Üíùïä that picks out the closed point ‚ä•.
Its fibres over ‚ä• and ‚ä§ are singleton and empty.
Let q:Z‚Üíùïä be its discrete coreflection.
But then because q is a local homeomorphism, Z ‚ä• must also be empty.

Idea A notion of internal ‚àû-groupoid is a vertical categorification of internal groupoid.
This is described below in the section ‚àû-groupoids internal to an (‚àû,1)-category.
Notably one may wish to speak of ‚àû-groupoids internal to an ordinary category.
These may be straightforwardly internalized in any ordinary category with pullbacks.
This is discussed in Internal strict ‚àû-groupoids
The general case remains to be explored.
This is described in Internal horn filler condition, below.
In that case simplicial objects in C are simplicial sheaves.
This is described in Simplicial sheaves, below.
This is described in Comparison, below.
So the right notion of morphisms of internal ‚àû-groupoids are ‚àû-anafunctors.
See model structure on simplicial objects in a topos?.
For more general C not much is known.
The Kan complex definition of ‚àû-groupoid may be internalized to more general categories.
In particular, the morphism is a stalkwise epimorphism, hence an epimorphism of sheaves.
A classical example consists of the topological ‚àû-groupoids.
The nerve construction makes a topological ‚àû-groupoid from a topological groupoid.
This is actually a characterization of topological groupoids among topological categories.
This is relevant to the construction of the classifying spaces for continuous principal bundles.
Another classical example consists of the ‚àû-Lie groupoids.

The word bilimit is used in two unrelated senses: 2-categorical limits ‚Äì
In the context of bicategory theory, bilimit is the relevant notion of categorical limit.

Systems of local isomorphisms on PSh(S) are equivalent to Grothendieck topologies on S.

Fibrantly resolve X in the other model structure in the same pair.

Below, we use the Serre model structure.
The topological simplex Œî:Œî‚ÜíTop is Reedy cofibrant as a cosimplicial topological space.
However, we can pass to the semisimplicial setting, as explained above.

One could call it the fat geometric totalization.
Contents Idea A vector is an element in a vector space.
The archetypical examples are tangent vectors.
Let M be a smooth finite dimensional manifold.
There are a variety of suitable categories listed at generalized smooth spaces.
We start with a smooth manifold, M, of dimension n.
Note that here manifolds definitely do not have a boundary.
For simplicity, we assume that it is orientable.
Let Œ∑:TM‚ÜíM be a local addition on M.
Let V‚äÜM√óM be the image of the map œÄ√óŒ∑:TM‚ÜíM√óM.
Lemma Let Œ±‚ààLM.
Define the set U Œ±‚äÜLM by: U Œ±‚âî{Œ≤‚ààLM:(Œ±,Œ≤)‚ààLV}.
It is an embedded submanifold of S 1√óTM.
In particular, the map Œì S 1(Œ± *TM)‚ÜíLTM is injective.
Hence (œÄ√óŒ∑) L identifies L Œ±TM with {Œ±}√óU Œ±.
A smooth such trivialisation defines a linear homeomorphism Œì S 1(Œ± *TM)‚âÖL‚Ñù n.
To investigate the transition functions, we need two loops.
In fact, let‚Äôs have two of everything.
Let Œ± 1, Œ± 2 be smooth loops in M.
That is to say, if and only if (Œ± 2,Œ∑ 1 L(Œ≥Àú))‚ààLV 2.
This is precisely the condition that Œ∑ 1 L(Œ≥Àú)‚ààU 2.
Let us define W 21‚äÜŒ± 2 *TM similarly.
Hence Œ∏ 1 is well-defined.
Define Œ∏ 2:W 21‚ÜíTM similarly.
These are both smooth maps.
Similarly we have a map œï 21:W 21‚ÜíW 12.
These are both smooth since the composition with the inclusion into S 1√óTM is smooth.
We just need to show that this is the transition function.
To do this, we show that Œ® 2œà 12 L=Œ® 2Œ¶ 12.
This construction easily generalises quite widely.
For more on the possible extensions, see the references.
The second diffeology is the one obtained from the functor F.
In particular, they have the same sets of smooth functions.
We say this in detail now.

For them the theory of modules is the theory of linear algebra.
Therefore we generally speak here of modules over rings and their higher analogs.
Moreover there is a 0-state such that œà+0=œà for all œà.
Quantum states have complex phases.
This linear structure is a crucial aspect of quanum theory.
It is at the heart of phenomena such quantum interference and entanglement
In macroscopic physics similar behaviour is known in wave mechanics for freely propagating waves.
Not unrelated to this is the term wave function for a quantum state.
But the relation between quantum physics and linear representation theory goes deeper still.
Here we discuss such n-modules.
This is achived by restricting attention among all categories with colimits to the presentable categories.
This way we arrive at the following definition.
Forming presheaves on ùíû is the free cocompletion of ùíû.
These two examples are directly analogous from the perspective of enriched category theory.
Then Mod A‚âÉ[BA,Mod R] is the enriched functor category.
See also at Pr(‚àû,1)Cat for more on this.
Remark This is analous to the Deligne tensor product of abelian categories.
Let R be an ordinary commutative ring and A an ordinary R-algebra.
Generally, ùíú may be called R-algebroid.
This is the ùí±-presheaf category, hence the enriched functor category [ùíú,ùí±]‚ààùí±Cat.
Motivated by this example one also generally calls profunctors ‚Äúbimodules‚Äù.
This is what the classical Eilenberg-Watts theorem solves:
This is the Picard 2-groupoid of ‚Ñõ.
Below we discuss two examples of this phenomenon.
For further references see behind the relevant links.
Let ùíú be an abelian category.
In this form one often finds the definition of injective resolution in the literature.
A special case of both are F-acyclic resolutions.
Let ùíú,‚Ñ¨ be abelian categories and let F:ùíú‚Üí‚Ñ¨ be an additive functor.
Assume that F is left exact.
Consider the case that F is left exact.
The other case works dually.
Similarly, the third condition is equivalent to R 1F(A)‚âÉ0.
For purposes of computations one is often interested in the following stronger notion.
Then every object X‚ààùíú has an injective resolution, def. .
This we now construct by induction on the degree n‚àà‚Ñï.
The following proposition is formally dual to prop. .
Then every object X‚ààùíú has a projective resolution, def. .
Proof Let X‚ààùíú be the given object.
This we we now construct by induction on the degree n‚àà‚Ñï.
Then there is a null homotopy Œ∑:0‚áíf ‚Ä¢ Proof
We now construct this by induction over n, where we take Œ∑ 0‚âî0.
The formally dual statement of prop is the following.
Let f:X‚ÜíY be a morphism in ùíú.
We construct these f ‚Ä¢=(f n) n‚àà‚Ñï by induction.
This completes the induction step.
By prop. we can choose f ‚Ä¢ and h ‚Ä¢.
This vanishes by the very commutativity of the above diagram.
In positive degrees it implies that the chain homology of B ‚Ä¢ indeed vanishes.
That the middle vertical morphism is an isomorphism then follows by the five lemma.
The formally dual statement to lemma is the following.
Let the differentials be given by (‚Ä¶).
By prop. every object X ‚Ä¢‚ààCh ‚Ä¢(ùíú) has an injective resolution.
So choose one such injective resolution P(X) ‚Ä¢ for each X ‚Ä¢.
This is what def. and def. below do.
We discuss now the basic general properties of such derived functors.
Then for all X‚ààùíú there is a natural isomorphism R 0F(X)‚âÉF(X).
We discuss the first statement, the second is formally dual.
But this means that R 0F(X)‚âîker(F(X 0)‚ÜíF(X 1))‚âÉF(X).
Let ùíú,‚Ñ¨ be abelian categories and assume that ùíú has enough injectives.
In fact we even have the following.
Let F be an additive functor which is an exact functor.
Because an exact functor preserves all exact sequences.
Let ùíú be an abelian category with enough injectives.
Finally let ‚Ñê‚äÇùíú be a subcategory of F-injective objects, def. .
By prop. we can also find an injective resolution A‚Üí‚âÉ qiI ‚Ä¢.
Consider the derived functor of the hom functor.
Choose any projective resolution Y ‚Ä¢‚Üí‚âÉ qiG, which exists by prop. .
First consider the same projective resolution but another lift cÀú of the identity.
Form then the pushout of the horizontal map along the two vertical maps.
Similarly the bottom right morphism is an epimorphism.
It also manifestly respects the projection to G.
Therefore this defines a morphism and hence by remark even an isomorphism of extensions.
The same argument holds true for R any principal ideal domain.
Let G be a discrete group.
Write ‚Ñ§[G] for the group ring over G.
This is called the augmentation map.
This shows that every cycle is a boundary, hence that we have a resolution.

This establishes the first equivalences.

This corresponds to looking at a sequence of infinitesimal neighborhoods of the diagonal.

The isomorphism classes of monic maps into every object A is a Heyting algebra.
As a result, Heyting dagger 2-posets are the same as division allegories.

Witten‚Äôs conjecture was proved by Jeffrey and Kirwan several years later.

For k=1 this reduces to the notion of Killing vector.
The analog of this for spinning particles and superparticles are Killing-Yano tensors.
For n=3, they specialize to the notion of surface diagrams.
Several definitional variants exist in dimensions ‚â§4 (see also at surface diagrams).
We provide details for the preceding definition.
The natural ‚Äòisomorphism‚Äô relation of manifold diagrams is framed stratified homeomorphism.
The definition has several important consequences, which we list in this section.
These consequences have been formally worked out in Dorn and Douglas 22.
This leads to a theory of combinatorial objects called trusses.
The full ‚Äòcombinatorialization theorem‚Äô is spelled out here.
Strata in manifold diagrams are, indeed, manifolds.
Moreover, they have canonical smooth structures.
Links of tubular neighborhoods in manifold diagrams are in fact well-defined.
That is, there is, up to isomorphism, a unique choice of link.
Manifold diagrams have canonical geometric duals (in the sense of Poincar√© duality).
Details are spelled out in Dorn and Douglas 22, Sec. 2.4.
Idea A topos may be thought of as a generalized topological space.
Similarly we have: Definition
For n=0 this reproduces the case of a locally connected topos.
The follow proposition gives a large supply of examples.
See locally ‚àû-connected (‚àû,1)-site/‚àû-connected (‚àû,1)-site for the proof.
This includes the following examples.
The corresponding (‚àû,1)-toposes are the cohesive (‚àû,1)-toposes ETop‚àûGrpd, Smooth‚àûGrpd and SynthDiff‚àûGrpd.
And it is a locally ‚àû-connected (‚àû,1)-site.
Then also ùí≥ itself is locally ‚àû-connected.
This appears as (Lurie, corollary A.1.7).
Finally, by the discussion here, œÑ ‚â§0 preserves finite limits.
Hence Œ† 0 does so if Œ† does.
For instance it induces a notion of Whitehead tower in an (‚àû,1)-topos.
For a more exhaustive list of extra structures see cohesive (‚àû,1)-topos.
The Prelude on Classical homotopy theory ended with the following phenomenon: Definition
See (this prop.).
As one moves down this list, the objects modelling the spectra become richer.
The most lighweight model for spectra are sequential spectra.
The following def. is the traditional component-wise definition of sequential spectra.
Write SeqSpec(Top cg) for this category of topological sequential spectra.
This construction extends to a functor Œ£ ‚àû:Top cg */‚ü∂SeqSpec(Top cg).
For details on this see Part S ‚Äì Thom spectra.
This gives the structure maps for a homomorphism fÀú:X‚ü∂Maps(K,Y) *.
Running this argument backwards shows that the map f‚Ü¶fÀú given thereby is a bijection.
But having both on the right or both on the left does not work.
Then consider the identity element in the top left hom-set.
By the commutativity of the diagram, these two images agree.
Hence [S 1,œÉÀú n] * is an isomorphism (prop.).
From this, all statements follow by inspection at finite stages.
The fourth statement follows with similar reasoning.
This means that we actually have a bijection between classes of objects.
But it is also immediate to directly check the universal property.
For such there are two other models for suspension and looping of spectra.
However, this map is non-trivial.
This we make precise as lemma below.
Therefore in expressions like Œ£(X[1]) etc. we may omit the parenthesis.
The second statement is a special case of prop. .
The other cases follow analogously.)
It is sufficient to check Œ£ ‚àû‚àòŒ£‚âÉŒ£‚àòŒ£ ‚àû.
From this the statement Œ© ‚àû‚àòŒ©‚âÉŒ©‚àòŒ© ‚àû follows by uniqueness of adjoints.
So let X‚ààTop cg */.
The point where this does become relevant is the content of remark below.)
This is called the ‚Äústrict model structure‚Äù for sequential spectra.
Accordingly, this carries the projective model structure on functors (thm.).
This immediately gives the statement for the fibrations and the weak equivalences.
It only remains to check that the cofibrations are as claimed.
Since components are parameterized over ‚Ñï, this condition has solutions by induction:
First of all there must be an ordinary lifting in degree 0.
This is sufficient to deduce a Quillen adjunction.
Hence Œ£ ‚àû sends classical cofibrations of spaces to strict cofibrations of sequential spectra.
This shows that Œ£ ‚àû is a left Quillen functor.
Therefore we first consider now cofibrancy conditions already in the strict model structure.
This is a shift of a trunction of the sphere spectrum.
Hence the claim follows.
With this, inspection shows that also the above morphism is a relative cell complex.
We now turn to discussion of CW-approximation of sequential spectra.
First recall the relative version of CW-approximation for topological spaces.
(Hence an weak homotopy equivalence is an ‚Äú‚àû-connected map‚Äù.)
Let f:A‚ü∂X be a continuous function between topological spaces.
By possibly including further into higher stages, we may choose i>n.
to this function factors it as S 1‚àßX^ n‚Ü™X^ n+1‚ü∂œï n+1X n+1.
Hence we have obtained the next stage X^ n+1 of the CW-approximation.
There we will give a fully general account of the principles underlying the following.
Here we just consider a pragmatic minimum that allows us to proceed.
This is often referred to simply as a ‚Äútopological model category‚Äù.
Such a situation is called a Bousfield localization of a model category.
Hence one also speaks of reflective localizations.
Write ùíû Q for ùíû equipped with these classes of morphisms.
Let f be a fibration and a weak equivalence.
Consider its factorization into a cofibration followed by an acyclic fibration f:X‚ü∂‚ààCofiZ‚ü∂‚ààW‚à©FibpY.
We claim that (œÄ,f) here is a weak equivalence.
Let ùíû be a right proper model category.
Let Q:ùíû‚ü∂ùíû be a Quillen idempotent monad on ùíû, according to def. .
The condition Fib Q=RLP(W Q‚à©Cof Q) holds by definition of Fib Q.
First we consider the case of morphisms of the form f:Q(X)‚ÜíQ(Y).
These may be factored with respect to ùíû as f:Q(X)‚ü∂‚ààW‚à©CofiZ‚ü∂‚ààFibpQ(Y).
This is provided by the next statement.
The resulting sheaf topos is also known as Dubuc‚Äôs Cahiers topos.
They form the Poisson-bracket Lie n-algebra of local observables.
Let RX=holimR rœÅ r *X C r.

The subobject classifier Œ© is an internal Boolean algebra.
Then it does not follow that Sh(C) is Boolean.
Every cartesian closed Boolean pretopos is in fact a topos.
Every subtopos of ‚Ñ∞ is an open subtopos.
Every subtopos of ‚Ñ∞ is a closed subtopos.
Proposition Let j be a Lawvere-Tierney topology on ‚Ñ∞.
Proposition ‚Ñ∞ is Boolean iff the only dense subtopos of ‚Ñ∞ is ‚Ñ∞ itself.
‚Ñ∞ ¬¨¬¨=‚Ñ∞ is the smallest dense subtopos (cf. double negation).
Conservely, suppose ‚Ñ∞ is not Boolean then ‚Ñ∞ ¬¨¬¨ is a second dense subtopos.
In a lattice of subtoposes the 2-valued Boolean toposes are the atoms.
Let ‚Ñ∞ be a topos.
Then automorphisms of Œ© correspond bijectively to closed Boolean subtoposes.
The group operation on Aut(Œ©) corresponds to symmetric difference of subtoposes.
This result appears in Johnstone (1979).
(See also Johnstone (2002), A1.6.11 pp.66-67.)
This includes Set and models of ETCS.
Any topos satisfying the axiom of choice is Boolean.
This approach, though, was eventually found not to be viable.
But other problems were found with this approach, rendering it non-viable.
An n-truncated ‚àû-groupoid is an n-groupoid.
It makes sense for the following to adopt the convention that A is called.
(‚àí1)-truncated if it is empty or contractible ‚Äì this is a (-1)-groupoid.
(following HTT, p. 6).
To generalize this, let now C be an arbitrary (‚àû,1)-category.
This is HTT, def. 5.5.6.1.
Similarly, the (-1)-truncated objects are the subterminal objects.
This is HTT, def. 5.5.6.8.
(See also HTT, rem. 5.5.6.12.)
f is (‚àí2)-trunacated iff it is a weak homotopy equivalence.
This is HTT, prop 6.5.1.7.
See HTT, remark 6.5.1.8.
This is HTT, lemma 5.5.6.15.
Therefore it is sufficient to prove the statement for morphisms in C= ‚àûGrpd.
So let now f:X‚ÜíY be a morphism of ‚àû-groupoids.
We now write X for X¬Ø y for simplicity.
This is HTT, prop. 5.5.6.5.
The left class is that of n-connected morphisms in H.
This appears as a remark in HTT, Example 5.2.8.16.
See also n-connected/n-truncated factorization system.
See there for more details.
So for instance for C= ‚àûGrpd we have œÑ ‚â§n‚àûGrpd=nGrpd.
This is HTT 5.5.6.18.
So n-truncated objects form a reflective sub-(‚àû,1)-category œÑ ‚â§nC‚Ü™‚ÜêœÑ ‚â§nC.
This is HTT, prop. 5.5.6.28.
By the above lemma, F restricts to a functor on the truncations.
evidently commutes since it just expresses this restriction.
This appears as HTT, lemma 6.5.1.2. Proof
First notice that the statement is true for C= ‚àûGrpd.
The claim follows now with the above result that L‚àòœÑ ‚â§n‚âÉœÑ ‚â§n‚àòL. Postnikov tower
See there for more details.
This sends a type to an h-level (n+2)-type.
The (‚àí1)-truncation in the context is forming the bracket type hProp.
See at n-truncation modality.
It holds, however, in hypercomplete (‚àû,1)-toposes.
Then f is 0-truncated as a morphism in Sh (‚àû,1)(C).
To some extent, this is so by definition.
So we have for n‚àà‚Ñï a reflective sub-(‚àû,1)-category nGrpd‚Ü™‚ÜêœÑ ‚â§n‚àûGrpd.
Let X be an object that is n-truncated.
This means that X‚Üí* is an n-truncated morphism.
Stability is a highly overloaded word in mathematics.
Thus one can talk about stability of solutions of differential equations under perturbations.
This is also related to the notion of stable equilibria in physics and engineering.
The equivalence is given by 2-dimensional parallel transport.
A proof is in SchrWalII.
There are many possible conventions.
Here we will concentrate on the combinatorial and simplicial version of local systems.
How does the n-grading affect the nature of the following definition?
In the ‚Äòdifferential‚Äô examples, the differential will usually be denoted d.
Almost always we will be restricting ourselves to the case n=1.
Extensions of any results or definitions to the general case are usually routine.
Let K be a simplicial set.
Here it says ‚Äúa local system‚Äù.
I suppose ‚Äúsimplicial local system‚Äù is meant?
I copied and pasted from them, so this slip may occur elsewhere as well.
Let œÜ:L‚ÜíK be a simplicial map and F a local system over K.
Now let F be a local system on K with values in ùíû.
For ordinary local systems this gives the flat sections.
(enlightenment sought!!!)
Now suppose F is a local system over K.
So what are simplicial local systems used for?
Is there a good motivating example?
Relating it to the other definition of local system, maybe?
Then there is a unique element Œ¶‚ààF p(L) extending Œ¶ œÉ.
Then the restriction morphism F(K)‚ÜíF(L) is surjective.

Also, it does not admit groupoid reflections.
This entry is a sub-chapter of geometry of physics.
For more on this see at geometry of physics in the section Smooth sets.
A smooth set or smooth 0-type is a sheaf on this site.
The topos of smooth 0-types is the category of sheaves Smooth0Type‚âîSh(CartSp).
In the following we will abbreviate the notation to H‚âîSmooth0Type.
The topos of prop. also has another site of definition.
There is an equivalence of categories Sh(SmoothMfd)‚âÉSmooth0Type.
The statement hence follows by the comparison lemma.
For the discussion of presymplectic manifolds, we need the following two examples.
This solves the moduli problem for closed smooth differential forms:
Proof This follows via prop. by the Yoneda lemma.
Mathematically this is a symplectomorphism.
This is the claim to be proven.
Situations like this are naturally interpreted in a slice topos:
A symplectomorphism clearly puts two symplectic manifolds ‚Äúin relation‚Äù to each other.
But it does so also in the formal sense of relations in mathematics.
Here Z is also called the correspondence space.
One says that correspondences form a (2,1)-category Corr(H)‚àà(2,1)Cat.
An important class of symplectomorphisms are the following
Definition Let (X,œâ) be a symplectic manifold.
This is equivalently a vector field v H‚ààŒìTX, the corresponding Hamiltonian vector field.
All these concepts arise directly from the following simple consideration.
Consider the phase space (‚Ñù 2,œâ=dq‚àßdp) of example .
A standard such choice is Œ∏=‚àíp‚àßdq.
The resulting short exact sequence is the real exponential exact sequence 0‚Üí‚Ñ§‚ü∂‚Ñù‚ü∂exp(i‚Ñè(‚àí))U(1)‚Üí0.
Phrased this way, there is an evident concept of prequantization of Lagrangian correspondences:
By Cartan's magic formula this equation is equivalent to Œπ vœâ=‚àídL‚àídŒπ vŒ∏.
The correction term is Œπ vŒ∏ =Œπ v(pdq) =p‚àÇ vq .

It is used in the explanation of the stability of matter of the second kind.
If X is compact, then this is an isomorphism, the Hodge isomorphism
This is called the Hodge decomposition.
This is an acyclic resolution of E and hence computes its sheaf cohomology.
The corresponding spectral sequence of a double complex is called the Fr√∂licher spectral sequence.
On a K√§hler manifold it exhibits the Hodge filtration.
A sketch of the proof for CPT maps is as follows.
A finite sequence of vectors is linearly independent iff its Gram matrix is invertible.

Jets are a coordinate free version of Taylor-polynomials and Taylor series.

It makes sense to speak of locally pro-manifolds.
We discuss a general abstract definition of jet bundles.
For X‚ààH, write ‚Ñë(X) for the corresponding de Rham space object.
We now indicate how the translation works.
A D-module on X is a morphism of (‚àû,2)-sheaves ‚Ñë(X)‚ÜíMod.
Typical Lagrangians in quantum field theory are defined on jet bundles.
Their variational calculus is governed by Euler-Lagrange equations.
The archetypal example is the Ruelle zeta function.

Category theory also gives us tools for unifying disparate mathematical and computational phenomena.
Could we apply the same constructions to HRRs?
That would unify two kinds of analogical reasoning implemented on very different representational substrates.
More precisely, that generalisation and instantiation can be represented as an adjoint pair.

This concept is an oidification of the concept of nonassociative nonunital algebra.
Any linear category is a linear magmoid.
A Lie algebroid is a linear magmoid that is not a linear category.

Nonunital rings with homomorphisms between them form the category Rng.

This is about the separation axioms in topology.
In this fashion one may impose a hierarchy of stronger axioms.
Often (but by far not always) this is considered by default.
T 2Hausdorffgiven two distinct points, they have disjoint
open neighbourhoodsthe diagonal is a closed map
Here we just briefly indicate the corresponding lifting diagrams.
This and more is spelled out below.
Notice that topologically disjoint sets must be disjoint.
Notice that separated sets must be topologically disjoint.
They are separated by neighbourhoods if they have disjoint neighbourhoods: ‚àÉU‚äá‚àòF,‚àÉV‚äá‚àòG,U‚à©V=‚àÖ.
Notice that sets separated by neighbourhoods must be separated.
Notice that sets separated by closed neighbourhoods must be separated by neighbourhoods.
Notice that sets precisely separated by a function must be separated by a function.
The classical separation axioms are all statements of the form
Assume first that X is T 0.
Hence assume that Cl({x})=Cl({y}).
Hence we have a proof by contradiction.
Conversely, assume that (Cl{x}=Cl{y})‚áí(x=y), and assume that x‚â†y.
Assume there were no such open subset.
This is a proof by contradiction.
Assume first that (X,œÑ) is T 1.
We need to show that for every point x‚ààX we have Cl({x})={x}.
This is true by T 1.
Thus (X,œÑ) is Hausdorff.
Also, all of the R i terms are rare.
R 1 = reciprocal, R 0 = symmetric.
R 2 = regular, R 212 = completely regular.
Proposition (T n-reflection) Let n‚àà{0,1,2}.
Here X‚ü∂t n(X)T n(X) is called the T n-reflection of X.
For n=2 this is known as Hausdorff reflection or Hausdorffication or similar.
; this situation is denoted as follows: Top T n‚ä•‚Ü™Œπ‚üµHTop.
It follows that f(X) is a T n-topological space if Y is.
This means that fÀú as above is well defined.
Moreover, it is clear that this is the unique factorization.
To see that fÀú is continuous, consider U‚ààY an open subset.
We need to show that fÀú ‚àí1(U) is open in X/‚àº.
But this is the case by the assumption that f is continuous.
Hence assume that [x]‚â†[y]‚ààT nX are two distinct points.
Therefore T nX is a T n-space.
Let (X,œÑ) be a topological space.
This is an equivalence relation.
In general, the specialisation order is a preorder.
Note that any preorder is the specialisation order for its own specialisation topology.
For locales, the axioms at the other end are clearest.
(Note that every locale is T 0, indeed sober.)
Specific examples should be found on the pages for specific separation axioms.
However, Tietze does seem to want them to be a hierarchy.
He never asks whether there exists of a regular space that is not normal.
But it is not on the same level as the others to him.
An original article is Heinrich Tietze, Beitrage zur allgemeinen Topologie.
However, we will describe both the first- and second-order notions.
Note that Peano‚Äôs original treatment was second-order.

A surjective function is also called onto or a surjection.
A bijection is a function that is both surjective and injective.
Contrast with the notation |B|‚â§|A| if there is an injection B‚ÜíA.
This could be generalised to any category with a terminal separator 1.
Therefore, every surjection is an epimorphism.
The space of arguments changes accordingly.
In many dimensions, hybrid versions are possible.

Relativistic field theory takes place on spacetime.
The concept of spacetime makes sense for every dimension p+1 with p‚àà‚Ñï.
We follow the streamlined discussion in Baez-Huerta 09 and Baez-Huerta 10.
This operation makes ùïÇ into a star algebra.
Hence the conjugation operation makes ùïÇ a real normed division algebra.
This implies the second statement by linearity.
It only remains to see that the associator of the octonions is skew-symmetric.
By linearity it is sufficient to check this on generators.
This happens in the proof of prop. below.
We write Mat 2√ó2 her(ùïÇ) for the real vector space of hermitian matrices.
This is called the Minkowski metric.
Such an operational prescription is called a physical unit of length.
For the mass of the electron, the Compton wavelength is ‚Ñì e=2œÄ‚Ñèm ec‚àº386fm.
Moreover we use square brackets around indices to indicate skew-symmetrization.
First we need to see that the action is well defined.
This is the Lorentz group in dimension d.
This is immediate by inspection:
This is the canonical action of the Lorentzian special orthogonal Lie algebra ùî∞ùî¨(d‚àí1,1).
Hence exp(‚àíŒ±2Œì ab)v^exp(Œ±2Œì ab)=exp(12[Œì ab,‚àí])(v^) is the rotation action as claimed.
For these a¬Ø=a and hence the condition a¬Øa=1 is equivalent to a 2=1.
This kernel reflects the ambiguity from remark .
This is called the Feynman slash notation.
With this equation (10) is checked explicitly.
Recall the Minkowski inner product Œ∑ on ‚Ñù p,1, given by prop./def. .

In dualising, things can go slightly ‚Äòwrong‚Äô.
There is another problem, coherence!
There is an obvious extension to n-simplices.
We send ‚ü®V 0,‚Ä¶,V n‚ü© to ‚ü®œÜ(V) 0,‚Ä¶,œÜ(V) n‚ü©.
This still does not get us a functor from Cov(X) to SSets.
These are discussed in the entry on pro-homotopy theory.)
How are the two ways around the coherence problem related?
(This explains why ƒåech and Vietoris homology are isomorphic.)

There is a modification w‚Ä≥:FGFŒ∑‚ÜíFŒ∑GF such that w‚Ä≥.(FŒ∑)=1 and (FGœµF).w‚Ä≥=1.
The induced equality FGœµ.FŒ∑G=1 FG is the counit of an adjunction FGœµ‚ä£FŒ∑G.

All that remains is to check is:
Extending the ultrafilter functor to Rel
First we slightly rephrase our earlier definition:
In particular, Œ≤¬Ø is well-defined.
This in turn amounts to T preserving weak pullbacks.

Then F‚áù Œæx, i.e., N x‚äÜF, is equivalent to ùí™ x‚äÜF.
This is because N x is the filter generated by ùí™ x.
The second equation trivially implies the first.
We now break up our Main Theorem into the following two theorems.
The first inequality (lax unit condition) was already verified in proposition .
This would naturally follow if ‚àÄ U‚ààùí™ xœÄ 2 ‚àí1(U)‚äÜœÄ 1 ‚àí1(U^).
First we need a remark and a lemma.
This follows by inverting the definition of the open sets in œÑ(Œæ).
It suffices to show that A‚äÜA +‚äÜA¬Ø and that A + is closed.
We will do this by applying the lax associativity condition, using an appropriate ultrafilter ùí¢‚ààŒ≤R.
First let us verify that such an ultrafilter ùí¢ exists.
It‚Äôs clear that ùí¢ 0 is closed under finite intersection.
Since U‚ààF and A +‚ààF, we can pick y‚ààU‚à©A +.
So we can pick a ùí¢‚ààŒ≤R extending ùí¢ 0.
We want to show that U‚ààŒ≤œÄ 2(ùí¢) i.e. that œÄ 2 ‚àí1(U)‚ààùí¢.
By the ultrafilter principle, we may extend this filter to an ultrafilter ùí¢‚ààŒ≤R.
Put differently, we have established F=(m S‚àòŒ≤(œÄ 1))(ùí¢),prin S(x)=Œ≤(œÄ 2)(ùí¢).
This completes the proof of the Main Theorem (theorem ).
Now suppose f‚àòŒæ‚â§Œ∏‚àòŒ≤(f).
As above, a subset A of S is open if A‚ààùí∞ whenever ùí∞‚Üíx‚ààA.
It is Hausdorff if every ultrafilter converges to at most one point.
Full proofs may be found at compactum; see also ultrafilter monad.
See Clementino, Hofmann, and Janelidze, infra corollary 2.5.
The following ultrafilter interpolation result is due to Pisani:
For more on this, see Clementino, Hofmann, and Janelidze.
The nonstandard defintions of open set, compact space, etc are also analogous.
So ultrafilters behave very much like hyperpoints.

and the extended positive cone is really a generalisation of the nonnegative upper reals.
In particular, the extended positive cone of ‚Ñù itself is [0,‚àû].
This doesn't include the motivating example, but the following generalisation does:
The Lie algebra is said to be nilpotent if ùî§ k=0 for some k‚àà‚Ñï.
See also at rational homotopy theory for more on this.
A contravariant functor is like a functor but it reverses the directions of the morphisms.
(Between groupoids, contravariant functors are essentially the same as functors.)
This matters when discussing a natural transformation from one contravariant functor to another.
This is naturally a topological groupoid and a Lie groupoid if done right.
Observe that f is a diffeomorphism onto its image.
It only depends on the initial and final transversal sections S and T.
Two homotopic paths with the same endpoints induce the same holonomy.
(Note, however, that the converse is not true.
Two paths with the same endpoints inducing the same holonomy may not be homotopic.)
In the presence of excluded middle, every relation is a decidable relation.

To make this precise, one typically uses the machinery of free algebraic structures.
Let X be a set.
A free monoid has in particular an identity element, which is the empty word.
We do not assume commutativity.
Let X={a,b} be a set.
Another common case is that in which the algebraic structure is that of groups.
Let X be a set.
As for monoids, we do not assume commutativity.
Let X={a,b} be a set.
In this context one calls J a source field.
The Euler-Lagrange equations for the modified action are: EL(S‚Ä≤)=EL(S)+J=0.
Every principal ideal domain is a noetherian ring.
Spectra of noetherian rings are glued together to define locally noetherian schemes.
One of the best-known properties is the Hilbert basis theorem.
Let R be a (unital) ring.
(We adapt the proof from Wikipedia.)
Suppose I is a left ideal of R[x] that is not finitely generated.
Putting d n‚âîdeg(f n), we have d 0‚â§d 1‚â§‚Ä¶
Let a n be the leading coefficient of f n.
Also g has degree d k or less, and therefore so does f k‚àíg.
For a unital ring R the following are equivalent: R is left Noetherian
Any small direct sum of injective left R-modules is injective.
Direct sums here can be replaced by filtered colimits.
Thus an extension to R exists by the injectivity of each I Œ± k.
Now take any injective I k with 0‚Üíùîß/ùîß k‚ÜíI k.
Therefore, ‚®Å kI k is not injective.
This is the target space of the theory.
But the target space can be something more general or more exotic.
Namely, let i:X d‚Ü™Œ≤X be the inclusion.
This entry is about the concept of subspaces of vector bundles and Lie algebroids.
For the concept in functional analysis see at distribution.
Let p:V‚ÜíM be a smooth vector bundle.
This reduces to the previous case for the tangent Lie algebroid.
Hence integrable distributions are sub-Lie algebroids.
Similarly, we can mix the q- and h- model structures on chain complexes.

Idea A diffeological space is a type of generalized smooth space.
(These mapping spaces are rarely manifolds themselves, see manifolds of mapping spaces.)
A diffeological space is then a set together with a diffeology on it.
Diffeological spaces were originally introduced in (Souriau 79).
They have subsequently been developed in the textbook (Iglesias-Zemmour 13) Definition
This assignment defined what it means for a map U‚ÜíX of sets to be smooth.
Therefore in the sequel we shall often restrict our attention to CartSp.
One may define a smooth sets to be any sheaf of CartSp.
A diffeological space is equivalently a concrete sheaf on the concrete site CartSp.
(For details see this Prop. at geometry of physics ‚Äì smooth sets.)
This is Prop. below.
The gap is claimed to be filled now, see the commented references here.
Write (‚àí) s for the underlying sets.
But this means equivalently that for every such œï, f‚àòœï is continuous.
This means equivalently that X is a D-topological space.
Further discussion of the D-topology is in CSW 13.
It may nevertheless be useful to spell out the elementary proof directly:
This can be tested already on all smooth curves Œ≥:(0,1)‚ÜíX in X.
Also Banach manifolds embed fully faithfully into the category of diffeological spaces.
In (Hain) this is discussed in terms of Chen smooth spaces.
We discuss a natural embedding of Fr√©chet manifolds into the category of diffeological spaces.
The functor Œπ:FrechetManifolds‚Ü™DiffeologicalSpaces is a full and faithful functor.
This appears as (Waldorf 09, lemma A.1.7).
This is precisely the condition on a sheaf to be a diffeological space.
The category of diffeological spaces is a quasitopos.
This follows from the discussion at Locality.
This has some immediate general abstract consequences
This is a general context for differential geometry.
See at distributions are the smooth linear functionals for details.
Cartan calculus for diffeological spaces is developed in
and reviewed in Mark Losik, Section 3 of: Categorical Differential Geometry.
So far there are only few works on homotopy theory for operator algebras.
The left homotopy comes from the computation laws for the operation Œº expressed above.
It remains to construct the right homotopy
Recall that a complete lattice is a poset which has all small joins and meets.
To illustrate this definition think of an irreducible subset of a topological space.
-types cover n-types cover Idea
When n=0 one also says that sets cover or that there are enough sets.
The converse seems plausible as well.
The converse, however, is not true.
Let us denote by AC 0= every surjection between sets merely has a section.
AC ‚àû= every surjection with codomain a set merely has a section.
Then we have Theorem AC ‚àû‚áî(AC 0 and sets cover).
The composite of this section with Y‚ÜíX is a section of X‚ÜíZ.
Let D be a prederivator and f:X‚ÜíY a morphism in D(1).
Therefore, in representable prederivators this definition reduces to the usual notion of monomorphism.
These are thought to be the categorical semantics of higher inductive types.
An image of a variety under a regular map is not necessarily a variety.
Then f(S) is also Zariski constructible.
If f:X‚ÜíY is a finitely presented morphism of schemes.
Thus, it can be avoided by systems based on linear logic.
Let P be any statement at all, and consider the set C={x‚à£(x‚ààx)‚áíP}.
This appears for instance as (MacLaneMoerdijk, theorem VII.5.2).
(Morphisms of sites C‚ÜíSet are precisely the continuous flat functors.)
This appears for instance as (MacLaneMoerdijk, corollary VII.5.4).
This appears as (Johnstone, Lemma C2.2.11, C2.2.12).
This is due to (Butz) and (Moerdijk).
Points of over-toposes are discussed at over topos ‚Äì points.
See also at Gabriel-Ulmer duality, flat functors.
The following classes of topos have enough points (def. ).
From a logical perspective these toposes correspond to consistent geometric theories lacking models in Set.

The universe U of non-fibrant types is itself fibrant.
However, it is ‚Äúalmost‚Äù contractible by the following argument.
It‚Äôs straightforward to show that P(zero)‚âÖA and P(one)‚âÖB.
This is not the same as a path Paths(A,B), of course.
Now consider (x:I)‚ä¢R(P(x))Fib.
Thus, we obtain an element of 0.
In other words, we could have a rule ‚ä¢AType‚ä¢RAFib and so on.
It may be related to Voevodsky‚Äôs conjecture above.
Consider the following type ‚àè P,Q,R:sProp(¬¨P‚Üí(Q‚à®R))‚Üí((¬¨P‚ÜíQ)‚à®(¬¨P‚ÜíR))
Call this type KP (for Kreisel-Putnam).
A former student of Alfred Tarski he has also coauthored a biography of Tarski.
Here x is called the numerator and y is called the denominator
A number of other ‚Äúsaturation‚Äù conditions are frequently also imposed for convenience.
A category equipped with a coverage is called a site.
See Grothendieck topology for a discussion of the objections to that term.
We call a site C subcanonical if every representable functor C(‚àí,c):C op‚ÜíSet is a sheaf.
The generalization to stacks using cosimplicial objects is then straightforward.
Because of the final condition, we may choose to consider only covering sieves.
For more on this see category of sheaves.
Every isomorphism is a covering family.
This is the standard choice of coverage on Op(X).
Sheaves for this coverage are the usual notion of sheaf on a topological space.
On Diff also good open covers form an equivalent coverage.
This is all we need in the definition of coverage.
See fpqc topology, etc.
On any category there is the trivial coverage which has no covering families at all.
The corresponding Grothendieck coverage consists of all sieves that contain a split epimorphism.
Likewise there is a geometric coverage on any infinitary-coherent category.
Any category has a canonical coverage, defined to be the largest subcanonical one.
in (‚àû,1)-category theory the corresponding notion is that of (‚àû,1)-site.
Such an (‚àû,1)-site has correspondingly its (‚àû,1)-category of (‚àû,1)-sheaves.
Thus, extension systems are equivalent to monads.
It is also possible to define algebras over a monad using this presentation.
This morphism is known as ‚Äúbind‚Äù in use of monads in computer science.
This is proposition 5.2.4.6 in HTT.
He is probably best known as the author of the influential textbook on algebraic topology
If M=x, then Œªx.x=I.
If M is a variable y‚â†x, then Œªx.y=Ky.
However, this overlaps with the third case and is not structurally recursive.
They play an important role in the theory of realizability toposes.
Every span of codegeneracy maps in R ‚àí has an absolute pushout in R ‚àí.
We have to show that f=id.
Since a is nondegenerate, it follows that f=id.
Let R be elegant and f:x‚Üíy a codegeneracy in R.
This depends only on the fact that f is split epi in R.
On the one hand we have A spœï=A sA f=A fs=1.
All presheaves are ‚ÄúReedy monomorphic‚Äù
Let R be elegant and let M be an infinitary-coherent category.
We use the terminology from the page ‚àû-ary exact category.
By absoluteness, A z is the pullback A y√ó A xA y.
Thus, the images of these absolute pushouts form the kernel of this sink.
Hence, L xA is the quotient of the above kernel.
Therefore, the induced map L xA‚ÜíA x is monic.
By assumption A x‚ÜíB x is monic.
The most common application is when M=SSet.
The simplex category Œî is an elegant Reedy category.
Joyal‚Äôs disk categories Œò n are elegant Reedy categories.
Every EZ-Reedy category that is a strict Reedy category is elegant.
Elegant Reedy categories are useful to model homotopy type theory.
Richard (Dick) Crowell was emeritus professor of mathematics at Dartmouth College.
Write œÑ œÅ for the corresponding topology.
Then (E(œÅ),œÑ œÅ) is a topological space.
It canonically comes with the function E(œÅ) ‚ü∂p X x^‚ààœÅ(x) ‚Ü¶ x.
Moreover, the construction f‚Ü¶Rec(f) yields a homomorphism of covering spaces.
So let x‚ààX be a point.
The argument for the base open neighbourhoods contained in intersections is similar.
Then we need to see that p:E(œÅ)‚ÜíX is a continuous function.
This shows that p:E(œÅ)‚ÜíX is a covering space.
It remains to see that Rec(f):E(œÅ 1)‚ÜíE(œÅ 2) is a homomorphism of covering spaces.
So it only remains to see that Rec(f) is a continuous function.
shouldn‚Äôt such a discrete fibration then give rise to a functor |B|‚ÜíSet?
I didn‚Äôt make myself clear then.
But hopefully my meaning is now clear.
Yes, I see now.
This is essentially the ‚Äúregular representation‚Äù of the fundamental groupoid.
This is then a groupoid over G by the restriction of ev 1.
We could then talk about quotients by wide subgroupoids being topologically discrete.
This covering space is, strictly speaking, universal among connected covering spaces

A locally finitely presentable category is an ‚Ñµ 0-locally presentable category.
Write C fp for the full subcategory of C consisting of the finitely presentable objects.
C is the category of models for an essentially algebraic theory.

C is the category of models for a finite limit sketch.

For k=1 this is torsion-freeness.
An Sp(n)‚Ü™GL(2n)-structure is an almost symplectic structure.
Hence first-order integrability here amounts precisely to symplectic structure.
The Darboux theorem asserts that this is already a fully integrable structure.
An O(n)‚ÜíGL(n)-structure is an orthogonal structure, hence a vielbein, hence a Riemannian metric.
The case of unitary structure is precisely the combination of the above three cases.

There are a number of approaches toward constructing realizability toposes.
The categories of assemblies and partitioned assemblies are denoted Ass A and PAss A respectively.
Moreover, Ass A is regular and locally cartesian closed.
This category is a topos, called the realizability topos of A.
See Grothendieck's Galois theory for more on the latter.
There are two ways to define a Galois category.

In other words pretriangulated dg-categories can be viewed as enhanced triangulated categories.
For this reason some authors call them stable dg-categories.
See (Tabuada 07, Theorem 2.2 and Proposition 2.10).
See (Tabuada 07, Proposition 2.10).
Strongly pretriangulated dg-categories Let A be a dg-category.

This was apparently first observed by Tom Leinster.
Thus every 1-connected bicategory can be pointed in an essentially unique way.
Thus, any two pointed transformations F‚ÜíG are related by a unique invertible modification.
It is well-known that this is precisely the data of a monoidal category.
This can be regarded as another version of the delooping hypothesis.
This statement holds in fact even for parameterized ‚àû-groupoids, i.e. for ‚àû-stacks.

the ‚àû-monoidal structure on the spectrum induces a multiplicative cohomology theory.
The category of CohomologyTheories ‚Äúis‚Äù the stable homotopy category.
The result is not even homotopy equivalent.
In the homotopy category the pushout does not exist.

The following exhibits the link between skeletal morphisms and Booleanness:
Conversely, assume all ‚Ñ±‚Üí‚Ñ∞ are skeletal.
By Barr's theorem, ‚Ñ∞ receives a surjective f:‚Ñ¨‚Üí‚Ñ∞ from a Boolean topos.
f being skeletal and surjective implies that im(f)=‚Ñ∞ is Boolean.

If one considers arbitrary differentiablity, then one speaks of smooth manifolds.
For a general discussion see at manifold.
Differential and smooth manifolds are the basis for much of differential geometry.

Smooth manifolds form a category, SmoothManifolds.
Now we make some easy observations: Fix(p)‚äÜg ‚àí1(0).
The derivative dg(0):T 0(U)‚ÜíT 0(kerdp(0))‚âÖkerdp(0) is œÄ again since Id‚àídp(0) is idempotent.
The tangent space T 0(g ‚àí1(0)‚à©V) is canonically identified with im(dp(0)).
Another proof of this result may be found here.
The theory of smooth manifolds appears if one takes ùí¢= CartSp.
This is discussed in The geometry CartSp below.
Let CartSp be the category of Cartesian spaces and smooth functions between them.
For ùí¢= CartSp this algebra is a smooth algebra in ùí≥.
The big topos Sh(CartSp) is a cohesive topos of generalized smooth spaces.
Its concrete sheaves are precisely the diffeological spaces.
See there for more details.
Let LocRep(CartSp)‚Ü™Sh(CartSp) be the full subcategory on locally representable sheaves.
By definition of manifold there is an open cover {U i‚Ü™X}.
The colimit in PSh(CartSp) in turn is computed objectwise.
In particular the inclusions U i√ó XU j‚Ü™U i are open embeddings.

Axiom 6 with axiom 5 together say that ‚Ñù is a commutative invertible semigroup.
Axiom 1 says that ‚Ñù has a connected relation <.
Axiom 2 says that < is an asymmetric relation and thus an irreflexive relation.
(the full axiom 4 is the Dedekind completeness condition).
Axiom 3 says that < is a dense linear order.
Let us denote the Dedekind-complete Tarski group as ‚Ñù.
There is an archimedean field structure on ‚Ñù.
Proposition ‚Ñù is a Archimedean ordered abelian group.
Proposition ‚Ñù has a complete metric
Proof Since ‚Ñù is strictly ordered, it is a totally ordered abelian group.
Proposition ‚Ñö embeds in ‚Ñù.
Thus, ‚Ñù is a field.

We consider the definition in increasing generality and sophistication:
The open subsets of the topology are the complements of these vanishing sets.
These are called the Zariski open subsets of k n.

Let k be a field, and let n‚àà‚Ñï.
We need to show that then already f‚ààI(V(‚Ñ±)) or g‚ààI(V(‚Ñ±)).
We need to show that V(‚Ñ±)=V(‚Ñ± 1) or that V(‚Ñ±)=V(‚Ñ± 2).
Hence we have a proof by contradiction.
The following says that for algebraically closed fields then this is in fact a bijection:
The proof uses Hilbert's Nullstellensatz.
But the Zariski topology is always sober, see prop. below.

By definition V(ùî™) contains all the prime ideals p such that ùî™‚äÇp.
We need to show that more generally ùî™‚äÇI for I any proper ideal implies that ùî™=I.
We need to show that then already f‚àà‚Ñ± or g‚àà‚Ñ±.
To this end, first observe that V(‚Ñ±)‚äÇV((f))‚à™V((g)).
It follows that V(‚Ñ±)=(V(f)‚à©V(‚Ñ±))‚à™(V(g)‚à©V(‚Ñ±)).
Assume that ‚Ñ± is a prime ideal and that V(‚Ñ±)=V(‚Ñ± 1)‚à™V(‚Ñ± 2).
We need to show that then V(‚Ñ±)=V(‚Ñ± 1) or that V(‚Ñ±=V(‚Ñ± 2)).
Hence we have a proof by contradiction.
That this is a bijection is the statement of prop. .
In particular there is the 0-ideal (0).
Let R=‚Ñ§ be the commutative ring of integers.
Consider the corresponding Zariski prime spectrum (prop. ) Spec(Z).
All the prime ideals p‚â•2 are maximal ideals.
these are closed points of Spec(‚Ñ§).
Its closure is the entire space Cl({0})=Spec(‚Ñ§).
Consider two sets X,Y‚ààSet and a relation E‚Ü™X√óY.
Define two functions between their power sets P(X),P(Y), as follows.
These satisfy: For all S‚ààP(X)
I E‚àòV E is idempotent and covariant.
V E‚àòI E is idempotent and covariant.
The first statement is immediate from the adjunction law (prop. ).
The argument for V E‚àòI E is directly analogous.
It follows from the properties of closure operators, hence form prop. :
Applied to affine space
These are just the Zariski closed subsets from def. .
We conclude by proving this statement:
For every g‚ààI‚Ä≤, we have f(x)g(x)=(f‚ãÖg)(x)=0 since f‚ãÖg‚ààI‚ãÖI‚Ä≤ and x‚ààV E(I‚ãÖI‚Ä≤).
This result is not completely obvious; it is sometimes called the weak Nullstellensatz.

Applying this to Met cont‚ÜíSet produces a category isomorphic to MetTop.
We say that U is amnestic if its groupoid core reflects identity morphisms.
In other words, a functor is amnestic if its strict fibers are gaunt.
We again say that U is amnestic if its core reflects identity morphisms.
If the composite U‚àòK is an amnestic functor, then K is also amnestic.
Even Met‚ÜíSet is amnestic, since the morphisms in Met are short maps.
The forgetful functor from a groupoid of structured sets is amnestic.
So long as this produces no additional isomorphisms, the forgetful functor will be amnestic.
Any strictly monadic functor is amnestic.
Conversely, any monadic functor that is also an amnestic isofibration is necessarily strictly monadic.
This evidently generalizes the familiar Cech cocycle data for traditional line bundles with connection.

The definition of the Deligne complex itself is below in def. .

We check the hom-isomorphism.

Let C be a category with pullbacks.
In particular, descent morphisms are closed under pullback and composition.
Moreover, in a regular category, the descent morphisms are precisely the regular epimorphisms.
Perhaps more surprising is:
In general, descent is about higher sheaf conditions (i.e. stack conditions).
(See, for instance, section B1.5 of the Elephant.)
In particular, this is the case for any topos.
However, there are also important effective descent morphisms in non-exact categories.
In Top, there are characterizations of effective descent morphisms, see CJ20.
These includes open surjections and also proper surjections.

* It is a (1,2)-congruence if D 1‚ÜíD 0√óD 0 is ff.
* it is a (0,1)-congruence if D 1‚ÜíD 0√óD 0 is an equivalence.
Let q:X‚ÜíY be a morphism in K.
If Y is posetal, then ker(q) is a (1,2)-congruence.
If Y is discrete, then ker(q) is a 1-congruence.
If Y is subterminal, then ker(q) is a (0,1)-congruence.
The forward directions are fairly obvious; it is the converses which take work.
Since K is regular, r is eso.
Thus we have a 2-cell f‚Üíg as desired, so Y is subterminal.

Locale theory is one particular formulation of point-free topology.
This construction is example 1.2.8 from section C1.2 of the Elephant.)
The locales arising this way are the topological or spatial locales.
A frame homomorphism œï:A‚ÜíB is a function which preserves finite meets and arbitrary joins.
Frames and frame homomorphisms form a category Frm.
The category Locale is naturally enhanced to a 2-category: Definition
(See for instance Johnstone, C1.4, p. 514.)
Dually, a closed subspace may be thought of as a potentially refutable property.
See localic geometric morphism for more.
This appears as Johnstone, theorem C1.6.3.
This appears as Johnstone, scholium C1.6.4.
Thus we have a functor (‚àí) L: Top ‚Üí Locale.
One finds that (‚àí) L is left adjoint to (‚àí) P.
In fact, this is an idempotent adjunction:
Therefore the adjunction restricts to an equivalence between the fixed subcategories on either side.
see also MO here
This appears for instance as (MacLaneMoerdijk, corollary IX.3 4).
Consequently, we often identify a sober topological space and the corresponding topological locale.
For example, Set is moderate.
See for instance (MacLaneMoerdijk, section 5).
Write Topos for the category of Grothendieck toposes and geometric morphisms.
This appears for instance as MacLaneMoerdijk, section IX.5 prop 2.
A topos in the image of Sh(‚àí):Locale‚ÜíTopos is called a localic topos.
This appears for instance as MacLaneMoerdijk, section IX.5 prop 3.
The functor L here is also called localic reflection.
In fact this is even a genuine full sub-2-category:
This appears as (Johnstone, prop. C1.4.5).
We may think of a frame as a Grothendieck (0,1)-topos.
The last category is particularly interesting: it is a full subcategory of locales.
This is the double negation sublocale.
But there are other interesting examples.
The resulting sublocale can be seen as the smallest sublocale with a measure 0 complement.
The notion of locale may be identified with that of a Grothendieck (0,1)-topos.
See Heyting algebra for more on this.
There is also a notion of internal locale, see also internal site.
See Stone Spaces for details.
Many notion here have straightforward extension to general Grothendieck categories.
These trees can, however, be arbitrarily branching at every level.

Let ùíû be a model category.
A weak equivalence between bifibrant objects is a homotopy equivalence.
Now to see that the image on morphisms is well defined.
Now let F:ùíû‚ü∂D be any functor that sends weak equivalences to isomorphisms.
Here now all horizontal morphisms are isomorphisms, by assumption on F.
In particular there are equivalences of categories Ho(ùíû)‚âÉHo(ùíû f)‚âÉHo(ùíû c)‚âÉHo(ùíû fc).
We discuss this for the former; the second is formally dual:
By corollary this is just as good for the purpose of homotopy theory.
Therefore one considers the following generalization of def. : Definition
Let ùíü be a category with weak equivalences.
Let ùíû,ùíü be model categories and consider F:ùíû‚ü∂ùíü a functor.
The conditions in def. are indeed all equivalent.
We discuss statement (i), statement (ii) is formally dual.

Let SmoothAlg (or C ‚àûRing) be the category of smooth algebras.
We give the proof below.
We may regard an object in T SmoothAlg as a module over a smooth algebra.
For proving the above theorem the main step is the following lemma.
A writeup is in (Stel).
So we only need to know how A acts on mixed terms.
In summary this shows that the forgetful functor U is injective on objects.
Finally we come to the proof of the full theorem above Proof
The above lemma shows that T SmoothAlg‚âÉSmoothAlg√ó RingT Ring is a bijection on objects.
Motivating applications come from equivariant homotopy theory.
This subsumes but is more general than the concept of structure in model theory.
One may formalize the notion of structure using the language of category theory.
This is discussed at stuff, structure, property.
However, notice that these two conditions violate the principle of equivalence for categories.
A special class of examples of this is the notion of structure in model theory.

Examples 0-monomorphism are precisely the equivalences.
Every morphism is an ‚àû-monomorphism.

A famous example are fusion categories whose decategorifications are called Verlinde rings.
There may also be extra structure induced more directly on K(C).

We are left with a mere set: the set of isomorphism classes of objects.
To understand this, the following parable may be useful.

Unfortunately they are defined using other terms that you might not understand.
We say a cohomology class is integral if it lies in this lattice.
Using this we define {f,g}=œâ(v(f),v(g))
It‚Äôs easy to check that we also have {f,g}=dg(v(f))=v(f)g.
The symplectic structure defines a volume form which lets us do the necessary integral.
Such sections form a Hilbert space H 0 called the ‚Äúprequantum Hilbert space‚Äù.
The group U(1) is the group of unit complex numbers.
Geometric quantization involves two steps Geometric prequantization Geometric quantization proper.

We consider a presentation, ùí´=(X:R), of a group G.

Write r=a 3, s=b 2, t=(ab) 2.
This group is free on generators corresponding to edges outside a maximal tree.
Note that the Cayley graph is planar.

It is thus another case of an identity among the relations for this presented group.

The figure-eight knot is a famous knot.
(equivalently, the non-cancellative elements form an ideal).
Then integral domains are precisely the approximate integral domains for which ‚âà implies equality.
A weak approximate integral domain is an approximate integral domain defined as above.
Thus addition is strongly extensional.
For multiplication, if xy#x‚Ä≤y‚Ä≤, then xy‚àíx‚Ä≤y‚Ä≤ is cancellative.
So multiplication is also strongly extensional.
The integers are an approximate integral domain which are an integral domain.
There exist commutative rings which are not approximate integral domains.

A pullback, on the other hand, is a connected limit.
Similarly, a connected colimit is a colimit over a connected category.
Let I be a finite connected category and F:I‚ÜíC a functor.
Since I is connected, it is inhabited; choose some object x 0‚ààI.
We begin with P 0=x 0 and p 00=1 x 0.
We begin with Q 0=P n and q 0=1 P n.
We then set q i+1=q i‚àòe.
Similarly, arbitrary connected limits may be built from wide pullbacks and equalizers.
The same line of argument shows X√ó‚àí preserves equalizers, so X√ó‚àí preserves connected limits.
Thus ‚àë X:C/X‚ÜíC preserves and reflects all connected limits.
However, the following is true.
Now suppose G:C‚ÜíD preserves wide pullbacks.
Then (1)C‚ÜíGD‚Üíhom(d,‚àí)Set preserves wide pullbacks for every object d of D.
Put I=hom(d,G1).
It also preserves the terminal object, hence by this proposition it preserves arbitrary limits.
The analogous argument works for finite limits.

Equivalently, this is the complex Grassmannian Gr 1(‚ÑÇ n+1).
For the special case n=1 then ‚ÑÇP 1‚âÉS 2 is the Riemann sphere.
The sequential colimit over this sequence is the infinite complex projective space ‚ÑÇP ‚àû.
The following equivalent characterizations are immediate but useful:
These form the circle group S 1.
The first characterization follows via prop. from the general discusion at Grassmannian.
Both of these mare are evidently continuous, and hence so is their composite.
This shows that the above square is a pushout diagram of underlying sets.
We saw above that q D 2n+2 is continuous.
By the nature of the quotient topology, this means that S‚äÇ‚ÑÇP n is open.

These differ in general.
A priori both of these are sensible choices.

Proposition (complex projective space is Oka manifold)
Every complex projective space ‚ÑÇP n, n‚àà‚Ñï, is an Oka manifold.
More generally every Grassmannian over the complex numbers is an Oka manifold.
This is due to (Segal 73, prop. 1).
The version for real projective space is called the Kahn-Priddy theorem.

There is a (Kan-) model structure on these simplicial sets.
Within S we can define a universe M and show that it is fibrant.
This universe is even univalent.

The quotient ring itself is called the ring of polynomials modulo p.
The Gaussian rationals are the rational polynomials ‚Ñö[x] modulo x 2+1.

Then an ultraproduct of those structures may be used to model the entire set S.1
Let us extract a more concrete description.
Ultraproducts of models To be written.
Such ultrafilters contain all cofinite subsets of integers, but not only them.
Unlike limits and colimits, an ultraproduct is not defined by any universal mapping property.
This approach to model theory is pursued in Bell-Slomson (1969).
For contrast, compare with the more sober view of Hodges (1993).
The quotient notation is traditional but (ever so slightly) misleading.
But it is useful to allow for empty models (when they exist)!

[‚ãØ] Without confinement,our Universe cannot exist.
Each represents one of the toughest challenges in mathematics.
Confinement and EHM are inextricably linked.
Electroweak theory and phenomena are essentially perturbative; hence, possess little of this complexity.
Science has never before encountered an interaction such as that at work in QCD.
The confinement of quarks is one of the enduring mysteries of modern physics.
Perhaps the most important example is four-dimensional SU(3)-lattice gauge theory.
All such questions remain open.
The second big open question is the problem of quark confinement.
Quarks are the constituents of various elementary particles, such as protons and neutrons.
It is an enduring mystery why quarks are never observed freely in nature.
This includes quark confinement, mass generation, and chiral symmetry breaking.
But we are lucky to have a tractable and fundamental problem to solve while waiting.
Hadrons are composed of quarks and are thus not fundamental particles of the Standard Model.
However, their properties follow from yet unsolved mysteries of the strong interaction.
The quark confinement conjecture is experimentally well tested, but mathematically still unproven.
And it is still unknown which combinations of quarks may or may not form hadrons.
QCD and its relatives are special because QCD is the theory of nature.
It does not capture drastic rearrangement of the vacuum structure related to confinement.
Non-perturbative methods were desperately needed.

Of course various partial approaches exist, notably computer-experiment in lattice QCD.

That k is a fibration is easily checked.
To see acyclicity we first notice the following Lemma.

The frame of ideals is given by a universal property.
The relevant locale is precisely the locale of ideals.

Such defects are known by many names.
In codimension 1 they are often called domain walls.

Then the space of such vacuum configurations is the coset space G/H.

The details vary depending on the monad and on the category under consideration.
See the table below for more details.
Here we just explain what most monads of this kind look like.
The Kantorovich monad assigns to each metric space the Wasserstein space over it.
(See also the table below.)
This can be thought of as the formal convex combination 12heads+12tails.
On the morphisms, the functor gives for example the pushforward of measures.
These can be seen as the laws of a deterministic random variable.
The multiplication of the monad is a map PPX‚ÜíPX for all objects X.
The following example is taken from Perrone ‚Äò19, Example 5.1.2.
Suppose that you have two coins in your pocket.

In complex analytic geometry this usually means a complex manifold of complex dimension 2.
Let us consider the formula for a derivative: f‚Ä≤(x)=lim h‚Üí0f(x+h)‚àíf(x)h
That is, we need the concept of a local addition.
This is, of course, the notion of a chart.
This leads to the notion of a local addition.
The broadest definition is the following.
Local additions are used in constructing the manifold structure on certain mapping spaces.
For details, see KM ¬ß42.
Applying this to the case N=pt, we obtain charts for M itself.
Let M be a smooth manifold, Œ∑:E‚äáU‚ÜíM a local addition on M.
Let V‚äÜM√óM be the image of œÄ√óŒ∑.
Let U p‚âîE p‚à©U be the fibre of U over p.
Let V p‚äÜM be such that {p}√óV p=V‚à©({p}√óM).
Let us start by showing that Œ∑ p is well-defined.
To find that, we look at the image of U p under œÄ√óŒ∑.
Hence the image of Œ∑ p is V p as claimed.
Local additions are used to great effect in constructing charts for mapping spaces.
Let M be a smooth manifold (possibly infinite dimensional).
Let N be a functionally compact Fr√∂licher space.
Let P‚äÜM be a submanifold.
Let Q‚äÜN be a subset.
We assume that the pair (M,P) admits local addition.
We shall also assume, for simplicity, that the domain of Œ∑ is TM.
Let g:N‚ÜíM be a smooth map with g(Q)‚äÜP.
By applying the projection to the second factor, we obtain a map f^:N‚ÜíTM.
Composing with Œ∑ produces a map Œ∑‚àòf^:N‚ÜíM.
The map f‚Ü¶Œ∑‚àòf^ is what we call Œ¶.
Let us identify its image.
Let V‚äÜM√óM be the image of the local addition.
Let us start with the image.
Together with the identity on N, we get a map N‚ÜíN√óTM.
Moreover, this construction yields the inverse of Œ¶ and so it is a bijection.
Thus we have charts for C ‚àû(N,M;Q,P).
The next step is the transition functions.
This will show that our resulting manifold structure is independent of this choice.
‚Ä¶ to be continued ‚Ä¶
Another useful construction from a local addition relates to diffeomorphisms.
So let Œ∑:U‚ÜíM be a local addition.
The square of the norm coming from a smooth orthogonal structure would suffice.
Let us write X v for this vector field.
By construction, the map v‚ÜíX v is smooth.

So in general KR-theory interpolates between all these cases.
Following this, KR-theory is usually pronounced ‚Äúreal K-theory‚Äù.

Regarding the second item: Consider the canonical free resolution 0‚Üí‚Ñ§‚ü∂p‚ãÖ(‚àí)‚Ñ§‚ü∂‚Ñ§/p‚Ñ§‚Üí0.
Both these conditions are equivalent to multiplication by p being invertible.
The terminology in def. is motivated by the following perspective of arithmetic geometry:
The residue field at that point is ùîΩ p=‚Ñ§/p‚Ñ§.
Similarly localization at p is localization away from all points except p.
See also at function field analogy for more on this.
Alternatively one may restrict to the ‚Äúinfinitesimal neighbourhood‚Äù of such a point.
Compare this to the ring ùí™ ‚ÑÇ of holomorphic functions on the complex plane.

Each horizontal sequence is exact.
Taking the limit over the vertical sequences yields the sequence in question.
Since limits commute over limits, the result follows.
Equivalently it is the abelian group underlying the ring localization ‚Ñ§[1/p].
This yields the first statement.
Hence by exactness there is an isomorphism Ext 1(lim‚ü∂ n‚Ñ§,A)‚âÉlim‚üµ n 1Hom(‚Ñ§,A)‚âÉlim‚üµ n 1A.

The formula (6) adapts this idea to simplicial sets.

Let X be a topological space.

Every GCD domain of dimension at most 1 is a B√©zout domain.
R satisfies the ascending chain condition on principal ideals.
For the converse, let œÜ be an arbitrary proposition.
Consider the ideal {x‚àà‚Ñ§|(x=0)‚à®œÜ}.
By assumption, it is generated by some number n.
Since the integers are discrete, it holds that n=0 or n‚â†0.
In the first case ¬¨œÜ holds, in the second œÜ.
However, this ideal cannot be proved to be finitely generated either.
Therefore, ‚Ñ§ remains a B√©zout domain.

Hopf algebras and their generalization to Hopf algebroids arise notably as groupoid convolution algebras.
Another important source of Hopf algebras is combinatorics, see at combinatorial Hopf algebras.

A preset is a set without an equality relation.
A given preset may define many different sets, depending on the equality relation.
As functions go between sets, so prefunctions go between presets.
Composition of prefunctions is also possible, but likewise does not preserve equality.
We define a relation between sets to be a prerelation that respects equality.
Many properties of relations can also be predicated of prerelations, but not all.
In general, prerelations are Presets, types, sets, and setoids
Presets do not have equality.
Thus, strictly speaking, the types in the type theories are not presets.
Instead, they only form a magmoid.
The sorts in Michael Makkai's FOLDS are presets.
As far as I can tell, it therefore does not prove the presentation axiom.
Let (X,g) be a compact Riemannian manifold of dimension 4.
Let G be a compact Lie group.
Therefore classifying and counting instantons amounts to classifying and counting G-principal bundles.
This is the case of ‚ÄúBPST-instantons‚Äù.
This is the 4-sphere S 4‚âÉ‚Ñù 4‚à™{‚àû}.
We see below that Chern-Weil theory identifies this number with the instanton number.
Therefore this class completely characterizes SU(2)-principal bundles in 4d.
Constructing instantons from gauge transformations
Topologically this is homeomorphic to the situation before, and hence just as good.
Gauge fields vanishing at infinity

As discussed before, we may just as well consider any principal connection.

The reason for trying this is in the spirit of centipede mathematics.
We shall work over ‚ÑÇ throughout.
We start with the basic definition of an inner product space.
We do this by using orthonormal families.
Using orthogonal families, we can express the notion of completeness as follows.
The other direction takes a little more effort.
A slightly more concrete route is as follows.
This results in an orthonormal sequence, say (b n).
By assumption, (s n) has a weak limit.
Thus (x n) also converges and so H is complete.
Their equivalence exposes some of the deep results of Hilbert space theory.
Fortunately, it is not hard to formulate separability without recourse to metric spaces.
I think you‚Äôre right about the square roots, by the way.

So we consider the question: is ‚ü®v,v‚ü©u=‚ü®u,v‚ü©v?
Or, equivalently, is ‚ü®v,v‚ü©u‚àí‚ü®u,v‚ü©v=0?
Moreover, we also know that in any case ‚ü®w,w‚ü©‚â•0.
Rearranging and square-rooting produces the traditional statement of the Cauchy‚ÄìSchwarz inequality.

Between groupoids with only a single object this is the same as a group homomorphism.

It first of all follows that the following makes sense
This is usually denoted Ho(Grpd).
Let X be a topological space.
The concatenation of paths descends to these equivalence classes.
This is the called the fundamental groupoid Œ† 1(X) of X.
Hence the fundamental groupoid is a homotopy invariant of topological spaces.
Let G be a group.
Let {ùí¢ i} i‚ààI be a set of groupoids.

It is clear that both induces bijections on connected components.
But this means F i,i and F j,j are group isomorphisms.

It is now sufficient to show that there are conjugations/natural isomorphisms p‚àòinc‚âÉidAAAAinc‚àòp‚âÉid.
Assuming the axiom of choice then the following are equivalent:

But ‚Ñù d also has (smooth) group structure.
As such it is the translation group.
These are the actual paths that free particles in X follow.
This is now mostly called a Cartan connection.
Here one regards the Euclidean group Iso(n) of all isometries of ‚Ñù d.
Inside this is the rotation group SO(d)‚Ü™Iso(d).
The quotient group is Cartesian space ‚Ñù d‚âÉIso(d)/SO(d).
and SO(d‚àí1,1) is the Lorentz group.
However, this is partly an illusion.
And this is secretly higher Cartan geometry.
To motivate these we now consider WZW models.
A miracle happens when one passes from Lorentzian geometry to Lorentzian supergeometry.
We come to this below.
This is also known as the WZW term in higher dimensional WZW theory.
All what we find here lifts as expected under Lie integration.

Nonetheless, the status of this claim is conjectural.

The negation of an apartness relation is an equivalence relation.
This bicategory is locally small and a univalent bicategory.
Let S be a set equipped with an apartness relation ‚â†.
Using ‚â†, many topological notions may be defined on S.
The ‚â†-closure A¬Ø of a subset A is the complement of its complement.
Similarly, a function f:S‚ÜíT is strongly extensional iff its antigraph is open.
(Then the graph of f is the complement of the antigraph.)
Note that every point is located.
Thus, he dealt with extended quasipseudometric spaces.
These details are not really important here.)
Thus, the opens in the locale X√óX are precisely the subsets of X√óX.
This subset is the extension of the apartness relation, i.e. U={(x,y)‚à£x#y}.
The apartness relation is tight just when this spatial part is the diagonal.
The axioms of the theory of apartness were formulated by Heyting (1925).

Recall the fundamental theorem of Galois theory for finite extensions of fields: Theorem.
Let A be a small parameter set in M.
A‚äáK corresponds to ‚ÄúA is an extension of K‚Äù.
The size of this orbit corresponds to the degree of the field extensions K(‚Ñì)/K.
If this orbit is finite, ‚Ñì is said to be algebraic over K.
Let K be a definably closed parameter set.
Let A be a normal extension of K generated by the finite algebraic tuple Œ≥.
Let ùïÑ‚äßT be a monster model.
Let A be a small parameter set.
The absolute Galois group Gal(A) of A is Aut(acl(A)/dcl(A).
Dually, if we take automorphism groups, we get: Aut(lim‚ü∂F)‚âÉlim‚üµ(F(c)).
So Gal(A) is profinite.

It is a compact manifold.
Let G n(‚Ñù q) be the Grassmannian of n-planes in ‚Ñù q.
It too is a compact manifold.
Then G n(‚Ñù ‚àû) is a model for the classifying space BO(n).
In the following we take Top to denote compactly generated topological spaces.
For these the Cartesian product X√ó(‚àí) is a left adjoint and hence preserves colimits.
Similarly the nth complex Grassmannian of ‚ÑÇ k is the coset topological space.
As such this is the standard presentation for the O(n)-universal principal bundle.
Its base space BO(n) is the corresponding classifying space.
Consider the coset quotient projection O(k‚àín)‚ü∂O(k)‚ü∂O(k)/O(k‚àín)=V n(‚Ñù k).
This implies the claim.
Consider the coset quotient projection U(k‚àín)‚ü∂U(k)‚ü∂U(k)/U(k‚àín)=V n(‚ÑÇ k).
The colimiting space EO(n)=lim‚ü∂ kV n(‚Ñù k) from def. is weakly contractible.

We first need the following preparations: Let T be the zigzag category.
Let C be a homotopical category with class of weak equivalences W.
Consider the functor category Hom Cat([t],C).
Let f:t‚Üít‚Ä≤ be a morphism of T.
Notice that if f ‚àí1(j) is empty, this procedure yields the identity map.
This proves that the assignment C (t)(X,Y):T‚ÜíCat is functorial in t.
This is a special case of concatenation, which we will describe as follows:
This is clearly functorial in both coordinates and defines a monoidal product ‚à®:T√óT‚ÜíT.
We send a pair of zigzags to their concatenation in the obvious way.
(Note that this picture is technically hiding the identity morphisms X‚ÜíX and Y‚ÜíY.
We omit them to show the hammock-shape, as noted below).
We describe the resulting category GrC T(X,Y) explicitly as follows:
This is clearly functorial by way of the results from our earlier preparations.
We now define the strict 2-category GrC by specifying the following data:
The objects are simply the objects of C.
The hom-categories are given by GrC T(X,Y).
We define the law of composition to be ‚à®.
Then GrC is a 2-category.
This is well defined since ŒΩ is a right adjoint and therefore commutes with products.
We call the simplicial category N(GrC) the simplicial localization of C.

On this whole page, assume that G is a finite group.
They become weak inverses once we restrict to semisimple module categories.
Its G-equivariant objects k‚àíVect G are simply Rep G.
Thus we define the 2-functor E as Eùíû=ùíû G.
It has an additional G-representation by right inverse multiplication.
Furthermore, it is an internal algebra.
Let ùíû be a ‚Ñ≥-module category, and A an algebra internal to ‚Ñ≥.
Thus the 2-functor Dùíû=ùíû G is defined.
There is an obvious faithful forgetful functor U:ùíû G‚Üíùíû.

Ideals show up both in ring theory and in lattice theory.
We recall both of these below and look at some slight generalizations.
Notice that all three kinds of ideal are equivalent for a commutative ring.
The preceding remarks apply to rigs as well.
See ideal in a monoid.
Ideals form complete lattices where arbitrary meets are given by set-theoretic intersection.
(In particular, every singleton subset is a base of its generated ideal.)
The top element of an ideal lattice is called the improper ideal.
An ideal is a maximal ideal if it is maximal among proper ideals.
An ideal I is a principal ideal if it is generated by a singleton.
(This is not analogous to completely prime ideals.)
That is, every element of the ideal is nilpotent.
A maximal ideal M is prime.
Because the ideal lattice is a quantale, multiplication of ideals distributes over ideal joins.
Suppose IJ‚äÜM for two ideals I,J.
Thus their join is contained in M, so we have proved ‚ä§‚äÜM, contradiction.

This is called the Heisenberg algebra.
The freedom to add constant terms to Hamiltonians gives the extended affine symplectic group.
For more on this see also at prequantized Lagrangian correspondence.
Notice then the following basic but important fact.
This gives the first statement.
In fact this holds true also when the pre-symplectic form is not exact:
This shows that the map is an isomrophism of vector spaces.
This gives the short exact sequence as stated.
Recall the definition of L-‚àû algebras.
So in this case the L ‚àû-algebra is equivalently a dg-Lie algebra.
This turns out to indeed be the case (Rogers 10).
We call these the pairs of Hamiltonian forms with their Hamiltonian vector fields.
Definition indeed gives an L-‚àû algebra in that the higher Jacobi identity is satisfied.
With this, the statement follows straightforwardly.
Recall the Deligne complex.
This we come to below.

An infinitary Lawvere theory is a generalisation of a Lawvere theory to allow infinitary operations.

Thus for each s‚ààS and x‚ààX s, we have the following commutative diagram.
This morphism is normally written ‚àè s‚ààSŒ± D s X s.
Firstly, we need to define this forgetful functor.
The forgetful functor Prod[ùíü,Set]‚ÜíSet S has a left adjoint.
Such a morphism is itself a natural transformation so we evaluate again at s 0‚ààS.
The counit, œµ, is a little more complicated to describe.
Let V:ùíü‚ÜíSet be a covariant product-preserving functor.
Let us now prove that these provide the desired adjunction.
The first part comes from FŒ∑ at F(X).
Under this, the identity morphism goes to the projection morphism described just above.
In this diagram, we have left off the subscript on œµ for conciseness.
The vertical morphism is that induced by the projection from (2).
That element can be written (f) f.
Now let us turn to the other half.
We need to consider the composition: U‚ÜíŒ∑UUFU‚ÜíUœµU
So we need to start with a covariant product-preserving functor V:ùíü‚ÜíSet and apply U.
is colocally small if it is locally small in the dual category.
In other words, (isomorphism classes of) quotient objects form a set.
A category is well-powered if its every object is locally small.
The following notions have been introduced by (BKS21).
Idea The concept of a codense functor is the dual of dense functor.
This notion is dual to the notion of dense functor.
Also, F is codense iff its codensity monad is the identity.
A subcategory is codense if the inclusion functor is codense.
Let I denote the unit interval.
A category with translations is a category equipped with a rudimentary notion of suspension objects.
This is the case for instance for the presuspended categories of Keller and Vossieck.

KK G is the category‚Ä¶
The KK-theoretic representation ring of G is the ring R(G)‚âÉKK G(‚ÑÇ,‚ÑÇ).
This explains the terminology of ‚ÄúMorita morphisms‚Äù, which originates in algebra:
For review in a broader context see also Nuiten 13, around prop. 2.2.34
It is however more special than that.
The general 1-truncated concrete smooth ‚àû-groupoids are internal groupoids in diffeological spaces.
(See also manifold structure of mapping spaces.)
See also the references at geometric stack and topological stack.
One also talks about anodyne maps or anodyne morphisms.
(see for instance (Jardine)).
See for instance (Jardine) for details.
The corresponding saturated class of morphisms is called that of dendroidal inner anodyne morphisms.
See (Cisinski-Moerdijk 09).
For simplicity, assume all enriched hom objects of J are cofibrant.
There are 18 countably infinite families and 26 sporadic finite simple groups.

This is sometimes called part of the statement of the homotopy hypothesis for Kan complexes.
This entry here focuses on just the standard classical model structure.
See also at simplicial homotopy theory.
Conversely, every simplicial set may be geometrically realized as a topological space.
For n=1 this is the standard interval object Œî 1=[0,1].
For n=2 this is the filled triangle.
For n=3 this is the filled tetrahedron.
However for working with this, it is good to streamline a little:
Better yet, SingX is itself already good cell complex, namely a Kan complex.
We come to this below.
These sets are taken to be equipped with the following group structure.
By the Kan extension property that missing face exists, namely d nŒ∏.
This is called an outer horn if k=0 or k=n.
Otherwise it is an inner horn.
This is the simplicial incarnation of the concept of Serre fibrations of topological spaces:
there exists a lift C ‚ü∂ X ‚Üì ‚Üó ‚Üì f C√óI ‚ü∂ Y.
The following is about small models.
In the induction one needs to lift anodyne extensions agains a Kan fibration.
Write F for this typical fiber.
This is an example of a general abstract phenomenon:
Topological geometric realization takes values in particularly nice topological spaces.
Topological spaces with this property are called compactly generated.
We take compact topological space to imply Hausdorff topological space.
It is a coreflective subcategory Top cg‚üµk‚Ü™Top.
It is a cartesian closed category.
This is due to (Gabriel-Zisman 67).
This is due to (Quillen 68).
See for instance (Goerss-Jardine 99, chapter I, theorem 10.10).
The fibrant objects are precisely the Kan complexes.
All simplicial sets are cofibrant with respect to this model structure.
For all natural numbers n, the unique morphism Œî[n]‚ÜíŒî[0] is in W.
Then W is the class of weak homotopy equivalences.
Then for 0‚â§l‚â§n, the horn inclusion Œõ l[n]‚Ü™Œî[n] is also in W.
Quillen‚Äôs small object argument then implies all the trivial cofibrations are in W.
Thus every trivial Kan fibration is also in W.
The Quillen model structure is both left and right proper.
Left properness is automatic since all objects are cofibrant.
This may be found, for instance, in II.8.6‚Äì7 of Goerss-Jardine.
Proofs valid in constructive mathematics are given in:
The theory ACF of algebraically closed fields is existentially closed.
In lambda calculus notation, q=Œªa:A.fœï(a)(a).
Hence s‚âîœï(p)(p) is a fixed point of f.
Thus epimorphisms need not be (weakly) point-surjective.
But retractions are automatically point-surjective.
(The shorter version above is a beta-reduction of this.)
Then every map f:B‚ÜíB has a fixed point.
This version of the theorem is emphasized by Yanofsky.

Let X by a differentiable manifold.
These are to be thouhght of as the infinitesimal paths in X.
So to some extent the tangent Lie algebroid is the tangent bundle TX of X.

In an ‚Ñµ 0-filtered category every finite diagram has a cocone.
The tower diagram category (‚Ñï,‚â§) X 0‚ÜíX 1‚ÜíX 2‚Üí‚ãØ is filtered.
Using this we have the central definition now:
A Œ∫-filtered colimit is a colimit over a Œ∫-filtered diagram.
A crucial characterizing property of Œ∫-filtered colimits is the following:
This is mediated by proposition .

A more general notion is that of monoidal monads.

Note that this GAT has no equations imposed on the sort algebra.
This GAT also has no equations on the sort algebra.
Finally, one can axiomatize the theory of categories with finite limits as a GAT.

Over the complex numbers K3 surfaces are all K√§hler, and even hyperk√§hler.
see Sawon 04, Sec. 5.3.
Homotopy All K3 surfaces are simply connected.
Hence the statement follows from Prop. .

On the other hand, most authors speak just about sieves on an object anyway.

There is a canonical way to create subfunctors from sieves and sieves from subfunctors.
A subfunctor is a subobject in a functor category.
It‚Äôs these subfunctors of representable functors that are in bijection with sieves.
The construction of S F makes sense for every morphism of presheaves F‚ÜíY(c).

But this is also easily checked explicitly.
Of course in general the cover will consist of more than just two objects.

We denote the category of situses by s·ãã.
With appropriate definitions, s·ãã is a full subcategory of sM.
Let M be a metric space.
We denote these by X ‚Ä¢ ‚â§ùîâcart and X ‚Ä¢ ‚â§ùîâdiag, respectively.
We use this to define situses corresponding to uniform and topological spaces.
This is the situs associated with the uniform structure on X.
In fact, it is easy to define uniform spaces in terms of situses.
A different choice of the situs strucuture gives a different precise meaning:
This gives the construction of geometric realisation due toBesser, Drinfeld, and Grayson.
See details at section 3.2 of geometric realization.
No homotopy theory for situses has been developed.
Consider a model M in a language ‚Ñí, and a linear order I.
For n=1 this can be reformulated as a lifting property in s·ãã as follows.

Algebras over this club are symmetric strict monoidal categories.
In this way, clubs generalize operads.
This generalization was performed by Kelly in CDT.
This applies particularly to closed monoidal, closed symmetric monoidal, and *-autonomous categories.
An answer more relevant to clubs will emerge in the next section.
There is no harm in thinking of G as an ordinary category.

For the concept in order theory see at direction.
vectors with the same orientation form an equivalence class.
The same holds for oriented lines and even higher dimensional oriented subspaces.
The equivalence class of a vector (or other object) is called its direction.
Unoriented directions have a representing unit vector only up to sign.
Unlike oriented direction, this makes sense over an arbitrary field.

Diese bezeichnen wir durch: œÄ 0(f):œÄ 0(X)‚ü∂œÄ 0(Y).

erh√§lt ein Homeomorphismus: f:(‚Ñù 1‚àí{0})‚ü∂(‚Ñù 2‚àí{f(0)}).
Die Lehre aus dem beweis von prop. ist seine Strategie:
Nat√ºrlich verwendet man in der Praxis st√§rkere Invarianten als nur œÄ 0.
Solche Pfade heissen stetige Schleifen in X basiert bei x.
As œÄ 0, so also œÄ 1 is a topological invariant.

This is in contrast to classical mathematics, where such principles are taken to hold.
Historically, constructive mathematics was first pursued explicitly by mathematicians who believed the latter.
This is the neutral motivation for constructive mathematics from the nPOV.
Here we write mostly about the mathematics, trying to be mostly neutral philosophically.
, simply remove choice and excluded middle from classical mathematics with nothing to replace them.
This is called neutral constructive mathematics.

To most mathematicians, this makes them seem quite strange.
, a new sort of constructivism arose.
It is common in classical mathematics to define things with an unnecessary amount of negation.
the Dedekind real numbers and the Cauchy real numbers need no longer coincide.
Similarly, the Cauchy real numbers are not sequentially Cauchy complete.
The set of all real numbers with infinite decimal representations are called prealgebra real numbers.
This allows one to translate classically valid theorems into intuitionistically valid theorems.
A constructive mathematician can be even subtler.
This practice can be understood through a careful distinction between object language and metalanguage.
: Mathematical truths are not thought to be known unless proved true.
Some of these are also useful internally or even classically.
There is also constructivism and idealism?

The weight of a space is the minimum of the cardinalities of the possible bases B.
But without Choice, we can still consider this collection of cardinalities.
Then a second-countable space is simply one with a countable weight.
(Euclidean space is second-countable)
Consider the Euclidean space ‚Ñù n with its Euclidean metric topology.
Then ‚Ñù n is second countable.
In this case it is called a topological manifold.
See at topological space this prop..
Subspaces of second-countable spaces are second-countable.
Properties second-countable: there is a countable base of the topology.
separable: there is a countable dense subset.
Lindel√∂f: every open cover has a countable sub-cover.
metacompact: every open cover has a point-finite open refinement.
first-countable: every point has a countable neighborhood base
second-countable spaces are Lindel√∂f.
weakly Lindel√∂f spaces with countably locally finite base are second countable.
separable metacompact spaces are Lindel√∂f.
Lindel√∂f spaces are trivially also weakly Lindel√∂f.
a first-countable space is obviously Fr√©chet-Urysohn.
a Fr√©chet-Uryson space is obviously sequential.
a sequential space is obviously countably tight.
paracompact spaces satisfying the countable chain condition are Lindel√∂f.

In homotopy type theory these are the (-1)-types.
We discuss some elements in the Lie algebra cohomology of ùî¶ùî∞ùî¨(d‚àí1,1).
The element Œ∑ abŒ∏ a‚àßŒ∏ b‚ààW(ùî¶ùî∞ùî¨(d‚àí1,1)) is an invariant polynomial.
A Chern-Simons element for it is cs=Œ∑ abe a‚àßŒ∏ b.
So this transgresses to the trivial cocycle.
Another invariant polynomial is r ab‚àßr ab.
This is the Killing form of ùî∞ùî¨(d‚àí1,1).
Accordingly, it transgresses to a multiple of œâ a b‚àßœâ b c‚àßœâ c a.
We have vol(E)=œµ a 1‚ãØa dE a 1‚àß‚ãØ‚àßE a d.
If the torsion vanishes, this is indeed a closed form.
Taking the cohomology of that complex yields monadic cohomology, see at canonical resolution.

The notion of 2-group is a vertical categorification of the notion of group.
The earliest version studied is that of strict 2-groups.
For purposes of internalization, one probably wants to use the coherent version.
For instance for H= Smooth‚àûGrpd the (‚àû,1)-topos of smooth ‚àû-groupoids one obtains:
By the discussion there, every ‚àû-group has a presentation by a simplicial group.
Similar statements hold for 2-groups with extra structure.
(See the discussion at Smooth‚àûGrpd for more on this.)
See there for more details on that case.
See string 2-group.
See Platonic 2-group Equivalences of 2-groups
Accordingly, it presents an equivalence of 2-groups.
Clearly also the kernel of the right vertical morphisms is the trivial group.
Beware that most of the above discussion is about geometrically discrete 2-groups.

If |c|>2 then for all n>0 we have |f c n+1(0)|>|f c n(0)|.
We prove the last statement by induction.
Now assume that there is n‚àà‚Ñï such that |f c n(0)|>|c|.
Pick such an n for r=2.

Now suppose that f is surjective.
Then there must be some element a:S such that f(a)=g.

Since n has no fixed point, apply Theorem .
Define f:S‚Üíùí´S as follows: f(a)={b:S|‚àÄ(U:ùí´S),i(U)=a‚áíb‚ààU}.
Of course, Cantor also proved Theorem , but his proof was not constructive.
Thus their composite would be a surjection ùí´S‚Üíùí´ùí´S, which is impossible by Theorem .
So in the arithmetic of cardinal numbers, we have |S|‚â§|ùí´S|.
So we conclude that |S|<|ùí´S|.
That is, each set is strictly smaller in cardinality than its power set.
So some other proof must be sought.
Proving there is no surjection X‚Üí2 X is an amusing exercise.

Let G be a group.
We shall see in Remark that all torsors actually arise as in Example .
It is possible to define torsors using a single-sorted algebraic theory.
A homomorphism of torsors is a map of sets that preserves this operation.
The equivalence with the two-sorted definition is demonstrated as follows.
The following diagram is cartesian.
Some of these may of course coincide.
Let œÅ:G‚ÜíT be a trivialisation of a torsor TÃ≤.
(See also at G-space ‚Äì change of structure group).
Thus œÄ 2:G√óB‚ÜíB acquires a group structure in C/B.
We restate this definition equivalently in more nuts-and-bolts terms.
The ambient category is C, as before.
But this is a very general notion of ‚Äúcover‚Äù.
This is the more usual sense when referring to principal bundles as torsors.
Or, ‚Äúcover‚Äù could refer to a covering sieve in a Grothendieck topology.

The adjective ‚Äúcartesian‚Äù refers to the existence of finite products.
We call this structure a 1-category equipped with relations.
We also call this structure a relation equipment or a 1-category proarrow equipment.
For instance, internal relations in any regular category also form a relation equipment.
Then ‚Ñã(KÃ≤) is a cartesian bicategory.
We can also construct this structure starting from a relation equipment.
(That is, ‚Äútabulations‚Äù in a certain sense exist.)
Then ‚Ñã(KÃ≤) is a bicategory of relations.
We first verify the axiom Œî ‚Ä¢Œî ‚Ä¢=1.
The factorization is unique since all 2-cells are unique.
We now verify the Frobenius axiom Œî ‚Ä¢Œî ‚Ä¢=(1√óŒî ‚Ä¢)(Œî ‚Ä¢√ó1).
The other Frobenius axiom is, of course, dual.
It is shown here that any bicategory of relations is an allegory.
Its boundary is the (n‚àí1)-sphere.
There are also combinatorial notions of disks.
See for instance (Makkai-Zawadowski).
We claim that the map œï:v‚Ü¶v/‚Äñv‚Äñ maps the boundary ‚àÇD homeomorphically onto S n‚àí1.

Supposing otherwise, we have w=tv for t>1, say.

Then C is diffeomorphic to ‚Ñù n.

A simpler proof is given in Gonnord-Tosel 98 reproduced here.
Observe that for 1/2<‚Äñx‚Äñ<2 the vector field V equals x‚Ü¶x/‚Äñx‚Äñ.
Also, all flow lines of V are radial rays.
(The subscript >1/2 removes the closed ball of radius 1/2.)
(Note particularly that the latter map is surjective.
The map g is smooth because for 1/2<‚Äñx‚Äñ<2 both definitions give the same value.
(Such œï exists by the Whitney extension theorem.)
Clearly f is smooth on Œ©.
We set A(x)=sup{t>0‚à£tx‚Äñx‚Äñ‚ààŒ©}.
Indeed, if A(x)=+‚àû, then it holds for obvious reason.
If A(x)<+‚àû, then by definitions of œï and A(x) we get that œï(A(x)x‚Äñx‚Äñ)=0.
As a result, ‚à´ 0 A(x)dtœï(tx‚Äñx‚Äñ) diverges.
Hence we infer that f([0,A(x))x‚Äñx‚Äñ)=R +x‚Äñx‚Äñ and so f(Œ©)=R n.
To end the proof we need to show that f has a C ‚àû-inverse.
Suppose that d xf(h)=0 for some x‚ààŒ© and h‚â†0.
From definition of f we get that d xf(h)=Œª(x)h+d xŒª(h)x.
Then there is a diffeomorphism to ùîπ n defined as follows:

Let L be a pre-gla.
It is a gla-filtration.
Q(L)=L/F 2L is called the space of indecomposables of L.
Let T(V)¬Ø L be T(V)¬Ø with the pre-gla structure given by the commutators.
We denote by ùïÉ(V), the Lie subalgebra of T(V)¬Ø L generated by V.
The inclusion ùïÉ(V)‚Ü™T(V) identifies ùïÉ j(V) with ùïÉ(V)‚à©T j(V).
The isomorphism between V and QùïÉ(V) identifies ‚àÇ 1V with Q(‚àÇ).
Let (L,‚àÇ) and (L‚Ä≤,‚àÇ‚Ä≤) be two dglas.
Their coproduct or sum (L,‚àÇ)‚ãÜ(L‚Ä≤,‚àÇ‚Ä≤) is often called their free product.
The differential on L‚ãÜL‚Ä≤ is the unique Lie algebra derivation extending ‚àÇ and ‚àÇ‚Ä≤.

Given types A and B, there is a function ae Aut:(A‚âÉB)‚Üí(Aut(A)‚âÉAut(B)).
A function all whose values are regular values is called a submersion.
In this sense transversality generalizes the concept of regular values.

For our target space, we shall take a finite dimensional smooth manifold, M.
Let us write this as Œ© ‚ô≠M.
It is easy to show that this does not admit a tubular neighbourhood.
In general the term fictitious gauge field could refer to any auxiliary gauge field.
This page discusses bases for the topology on topological spaces.
For the concept of topological linear basis see at basis in functional analysis.
For bases on sites, that is for Grothendieck topologies, see at Grothendieck pretopology.
This is the application to topology of the general concept of base.
See below for a characterisation of which collections these can be.
Now fix a point a in X.
The minimum cardinality of a base of X is the weight of X.
The supremum of the characters at all points of X is the character of X.
Therefore, every metric space is first-countable.
Therefore, every separable metric space is second-countable.
Let X be simply a set.
(The resulting base will actually be closed under intersection.)
This poset is in fact a lattice.
The greatest common divisor of a,b is their meet in this lattice.
In particular, a topological group does not act continuously on itself, in general.
See category of G sets.
Since X has the discrete topology, {x} is an open subset of X.
So Œº ‚àí1({x}) is open.
Conversely, suppose each such set is open.
So it suffices to show that each Œº ‚àí1({a}) is open.
We have Œº ‚àí1({a})=‚ãÉ x‚ààX{g‚ààG:g‚ãÖx=a}√ó{x}.
If there is no such g, then this is empty, hence open.
Otherwise, let g 0 be such that g 0‚ãÖx=a.
Then we have {g‚ààG:g‚ãÖx=a}=g 0‚ãÖI x.
In the following examples, all groups are discrete.
A ‚Ñ§ 2-set is a set equipped with an involution.
A normal subgroup N‚ä≤G defines a G-set by the action of conjugation.
This is used in the construction of the basic Fraenkel model.
A common fix is to use ambient isotopy instead.
But one may also use smooth isotopy.
(see e.g. Greene 13 or MO discussion here).
There are various different conditions that are sufficient for this being well defined.
This is hence called the pullback of distributions.

Here is one special case.
For R a ring, write RMod for its category of modules.

This is called the coextension of scalars along the ring homomorphism ‚Ñ§‚ÜíR.
We have œÄ k(Œû)=0 for ‚àí4<k<0.

Let ùíØ be a smooth topos with line object R.
The main point of this definition is the following property.
D‚ÜíX D is defined componentwise by (Œ±‚ãÖv):d‚Ü¶v(Œ±‚ãÖd).
One checks that this is indeed unital, associative and distributive. ‚Ä¶
A large class of examples is implied by the following proposition.
In every smooth topos (ùíØ,R) we have the following.
The standard line R is microlinear.
(See limits and colimits by example if you don‚Äôt find it obvious.)
All representable objects in these smooth toposes are microlinear.
The line object R is representable in each case, R=‚ÑìC ‚àû(‚Ñù).
Now, the Yoneda embedding Y:ùïÉ‚ÜíPSh(C) preserves limits and exponentials.
So models of second order algebraic theories are first order algebraic theories with additional structure.

The notion of algebraic Kan complex is an algebraic definition of ‚àû-groupoids.
It builds on the classical geometric definition of ‚àû-groupoids in terms of Kan complexes.
Notably the homotopy hypothesis is true for algebraic Kan complexes.
This defines the category AlgKan of algebraic Kan complexes.
A slight variant of this definition is that of a simplicial T-complex.
This means that algebraic Kan complexes are formally an algebraic model for higher categories.

This explains the term ‚Äòmonoidal category‚Äô.
A monoidal category can also be considered a one-object bicategory.
See there for more details.
Remark (making the ambient structure morphisms explicit)
We reproduce his arguments here.
Similarly, the following equation holds: œÅ xy=(xœÅ y)‚àòŒ± x,y,1.
We prove only the first equation; the proof of the second is entirely analogous.
The equation Œª 1=œÅ 1:1‚äó1‚Üí1 holds in a monoidal category.
Since ‚àí‚äó1 is an equivalence, it suffices to show Œª 11=œÅ 11.
In this case the pentagon identity and the triangle identities hold automatically.
Every monoidal category is also equivalent In MonCat to a skeletal monoidal category.
In this logical context the string diagrams of monoidal categories are called proof nets.
The proof uses the Eckmann-Hilton argument.
Where the definition comes from
For example, one might wonder if we can define monoidal categories using internalization.
Furthermore, hardly any of the monoidal categories in nature are strict.
But where do the coherence laws come from?
This fact is another version of Mac Lane‚Äôs Coherence Theorem.
Two other closely related approaches involve 2-monad theory and homotopy theory.
For instance the pentagon diagram above is nothing but the 4th oriental!
The tensor product itself is the second oriental, and the associator the third.
The following section explains this in a bit more detail.
This is part of a more general principle.

So in particular a Cisinski model structure always exists.
After some preliminaries, the main statement is theorem below.
(This follows sections 1.2 and 1.3 of Cisinski 06).
Let A be a small category.
Further below in def. this defines a model category structure on PSh(A).
A functorial cylinder object over A is a section of this functor.
This is (Cisinski 06, def. 1.3.1).
We say J-homotopy for the equivalence relation generated by this.
It is sufficient to show that elementary J-homotopies are compatible with composition.
Together this generates a J-homotopy f‚Ä≤‚àòf‚áíg‚Ä≤‚àòg.
Hence the following is well defined.
Write Q:PSh(A)‚ÜíHo J(A) for the projection functor.
Every acyclic fibration in PSh(A) is a J-homotopy equivalence.
So the statement follows with remark .
The disjointness of the two points ensures that *‚àê*‚Üí(‚àÇ 0,‚àÇ 1)I is a monomorphism.
Let I:=Œ© be the subobject classifier in the presheaf topos PSh(A).
By prop. , X‚ààPSh(A) is |Mor(A/X)|-compact.
Since monomorphisms are closed under these operations, the second statement follows.
Therefore also their composite I‚äój is anodyne.
, that of generating acyclic cofibrations is prop. below.
We discuss the proof of prop. below in Completeness.
We collect lemmas to prove theorem and related statements.
Finally, the proof of the equivalence of the conditions of completeness is in Completeness.
Every J-homotopy equivalence, def. , is a weak equivalence.
The first statement holds by definition of Ho J.
The second statement also follows directly from the definition.
We discuss the lifting properties in the model structure of def. .
For this it is sufficient to show prop. .
This we do now, after a lemma.
It is strong if h‚àò(I‚äóf)=œÉ Y‚àò(I‚äóf).
Every section of an acyclic fibration is a strong deformation retract.
The first statement is a direct consequence of prop .
We need to show that it has the right lifting property against all monomorphisms.
So by lemma with q also p is an acyclic fibration.
However, we can say more by appealing to general machinery.
This section follows (Cisinski 06, section 1.2).
We start with some entirely general statements about compact objects.
For X‚ààPSh(A), write A/X for the category of elements of X.
In other words: X is a |Mor(A/X)|-compact object.
The following lemma will be used to show that cellular structures always exist.
(Cisinski 06, prop. 1.2.27), also sketched at cellular model.
every object is Œ±-small, for some Œ±.
we can apply the small object argument.
This is the statement of prop. below.
Establishing this takes a few technical lemmas.
Proof Is is clear that every J-homotopy is a weak equivalence.
Conversely, let f:X‚ÜíY be a weak equivalence between fibrant objects.
Proof That the former implies the latter was the statement of lemma .
This being strong means that p‚àòk=p‚àòœÉ X.
One see that l:=h‚àò‚àÇ L 0 is a lift of the original square above.
We already know from prop. that acyclic fibrations are weak equivalences.
We need to show that p is an acyclic fibration.
By lemma p is also a J-homotopy equivalence.
Set then s:=k‚Ä≤‚àò‚àÇ Y 0.
One finds then p‚àòs=id Y.
By lemma we already know that every anodyne extension is a weak equivalence.
Since j is a weak equivalence, by 2-out-of-3 so is q.
By lemma q is an acyclic fibration.
Hence with j also i is an anodyne extension.
The acyclic cofibrations are stable under transfinite composition and pushouts
Every strong deformation retract is an anodyne extension.
Every anodyne extension between fibrant objects is a strong deformation retract.
There exists a set of generating acyclic cofibrations.
By prop. and prop. we may apply the small object argument.
We list lemmas to show prop. .
The elements of W we call W-equivalences.
The minimal A-localizer is W(‚àÖ).
This is called the minimal model structure on PSh(A).

Let Path n denote the set of monotonic lattice paths satisfying the diagonal conditions.
There are several ways of establishing the binomial expressions for C n mentioned above.
Hence for n‚â•0 we have the recursive equation C n+1=‚àë j+k=nC jC k.
Let S n be the set of functions f:[2n]‚Üí{1,‚àí1} for which ‚àë i=0 2nf(i)=1.
Thus the orbit of any f‚ààS n contains a stay-ahead race.

In other words, double negation is the composite of negation with itself.
More abstractly, double negation is the identity function on any boolean algebra.
In intuitionistic logic, double negation is weaker than the identity.
That is, we have P‚áí¬¨¬¨P but not conversely.
In paraconsistent logic, it is the other way around.
Accordingly, double negation is usually not the identity on a frame.
However, the operation of double negation is a nucleus on any frame.
In constructive mathematics, the same holds except that S must also have decidable equality.
The double negation morphism ¬¨¬¨:Œ©‚ÜíŒ© constitutes a Lawvere-Tierney topology on ‚Ñ∞.

Since the inclusion of 2 into H is fully faithful, it follows that ker(f)(0)=ulcornerfurcorner(0)=x.
The quotient of M defined to be its K-weighted colimit.
This is a functor 2‚ÜíC, i.e. a single morphism in C.
In other words, it is a factorization of f.
Often the factorizations produced in this way are familiar.
That is, H is the ‚Äúwalking fork.‚Äù
The factorization of f:x‚Üíy obtained in this way is x‚Üí(x‚äîy)‚Üí[f,id]y.
Then kernel data is a 2-cell, and its quotient is its coinverter.
The kernel of a morphism is sometimes called its invertee?.
In particular, it need not give a factorization system of any kind.
This sort of idea has been thought of by various people at various times.
It is a whole program transformation.
it does not equate lambda abstractions that are semantically equal but syntactically different.
(Thus it violates both existence and uniqueness in the universal property.)
Consider the factorial function in continuation-passing style, written in Haskell:
And now we can write the program without lambda abstractions:

A symmetric function is roughly a polynomial that is invariant under permutation of its variables.
The only symmetric polynomials in infinitely many variables are the constants.
These basis elementa are called the elementary symmetric functions.
There is also a noncommutative analogue: noncommutative symmetric functions.
Symmetric functions play a fundamental role throughout representation theory, combinatorics and algebraic topology.
The ring of symmetric functions, Œõ, has many interesting properties.
It is also a plethory.
For more on this, see Schur functor.
It also works when k has characteristic p and n is not divisible by p.
Apart from this, the field matters a lot.
One can study symmetric functions in any characteristic, or over any integral domain.

Type theory which is not extensional is called intensional type theory.
The origin of the names ‚Äúextensional‚Äù and ‚Äúintensional‚Äù is somewhat confusing.
In fact they refer to the behavior of the definitional equality.
However, we can derive this with the induction rule for identity types.
Extensional type theory is often presented in this form.
Extensional Martin-L√∂f type theory does not have decidable type checking.
See intensional type theory for more on this.
Our results certainly apply to most of the Majorana experiments during 2012‚Äì2021 in the literature.
At the same time, the amount of data is extremely narrow.

Any context-free language is also context-sensitive.

Such a top may not exist; if it does, then it is unique.

Taken together, all generalized cup products organize into the sequence operad.
We are now ready to define generalized cup products.
(See Lemma 2.12, Definition 2.13, and Definition 2.14 in Cochain.)
Thus, in the sequence operad such degenerate operations must be modded out.
The remaining operations form a basis of the sequence operad.
(See Remark 2.11 in Cochain.)
This must satisfy some axioms:
Centred: The principal ultrafilter F x={A|x‚ààA} at x converges to x;
Isotone: If F‚äÜG and F‚Üíx, then G‚Üíx;
In light of (2), it follows that F‚à©G‚Üíx itself.
It follows that F‚Üíx if and only if F‚à©F x does.
(But that is sort of a tongue twister.)
In this way, convergence spaces form a concrete category Conv.
Here we follow the terminology of Lowen-Colebunders.
In general, this convergence space does not fit into any of the examples below.
A pseudotopological space is a convergence space satisfying the star property:
Note that every pretopological space is pseudotopological.
A convergence space is topological if it comes from a topology on S.
In this way, the definitions below are all suggested by theorems about topological spaces.
Every Cauchy space is a convergence space.
The improper filter (the power set of S) converges to every point.
Equivalently (assuming the ultrafilter theorem), S is compact iff every ultrafilter converges.
That is, it is an algebra for the pointed endofunctor ùí∞.
In this way, PsTop becomes a reflective subcategory of Conv over Set.
For more on these, see pretopological space.
The inclusions Top‚ÜíPreTop‚ÜíPsTop‚ÜíConv are all inclusions of full subcategories over Set.

The symmetric group S n acts on C n by permuting coordinates.
This approach, though, was eventually found not to be viable.

As are further ways around these:
Let X be a smooth manifold, œâ‚ààŒ© n+1(X) a differential form.
See also the definition at multisymplectic geometry.
For X orientable, take œâ the volume form.
Then (G,œâ ŒΩ) is 2-plectic.
Poisson L ‚àû-algebras To an ordinary symplectic manifold is associated its Poisson algebra.
Underlying this is a Lie algebra, whose Lie bracket is the Poisson bracket.
Here œâ^:T xX‚ÜíT x *X is an isomorphism.
Then (C ‚àû(X,),{‚àí,‚àí}) is a Poisson algebra.
We can generalize this to n-plectic geometry.
Let (X,œâ) be n-plectic for n>1.
Observe that then œâ^:T xX‚Üí‚àß nT xX is no longer an isomorphism in general.
This makes v Œ± uniquely defined.
Denote the collection of Hamiltonian forms by Œ© Hamilt n‚àí1(X).
This satisfies k d{Œ±,Œ≤}=‚àíœâ([v Œ±,v Œ≤],‚àí,‚ãØ,‚àí).
So the Jacobi dientity fails up to an exact term.
This will yield the structure of an L-infinity algebra.
This is the Poisson bracket Lie n-algebra.
This appears as (Rogers 11, theorem 3.14).
For n=1 this recovers the definition of the Lie algebra underlying a Poisson algebra.
Recall for n=1 the mechanism of geometric quantization of a symplectic manifold.
One finds that this is the case precisely if df=‚àíŒπ vœâ.

The proofs can be found spelled out (dually) at epimorphism.
If gf is an monomorphism, so is f.
(In an adhesive category they are also preserved by pushout.)
We have seen some ways in which monomorphisms get along with limits.
Proposition Any morphism from a terminal object is a monomorphism.
The product of monomorphisms is a monomorphism.
Monomorphisms do not get along quite as well with colimits.
At epimorphism there is a long list of variations on the concept of epimorphism.
Frequently, regular and strong monos coincide.
In Ab and in any abelian category, all monomorphisms are normal.
Related concepts isomorphism classes of monomorphism define subobjects.
This iterative conception finds alternative expression in algebraic set theory.
There are also weaker variants of ZFC, especially for constructive and predicative mathematics.
There is an empty set: a set ‚àÖ with no elements.
There is a set œâ of finite ordinals as pure sets.

The construction of ƒåech homology used coverings of the space by families of open sets.
The way the open sets overlap gives ‚Äòcombinatorial‚Äô information on the space.
Historically these data were organized as a simplicial complex, rather than a simplicial set.
There are separate entries in nlab for ƒåech homology and ƒåech cohomology.
It is also not the (Alexander‚ÄìSpanier) dual of ƒåech cohomology.
The two problems can be avoided at the same time using coherent homotopy theory.
The resulting homology is one which is exact.
see ƒåech cohomology and ƒåech homotopy for more on this.
The first papers on this approach were by Tim Porter.
This relates to Steenrod-Sitnikov homology.

The natural deduction rules for strict and weak sharp types are provided as follows:
We only define left weakly reductive semigroups, right weakly reductive semigroups are defined similarly.
The map f:x‚Ü¶x l is then a morphism in the category of semigroups.
We call (S,‚ãÖ) left weakly reductive, if f is an isomorphism.
In particular, any monoid is weakly reductive.
Any left weakly reductive commutative semigroup is weakly reductive.
A monogenic semigroup that isn‚Äôt a group is not weakly reductive.
There exists unique smallest left weakly reductive semigroup which isn‚Äôt a left monoid.

This position has been voiced famously in G√∂del (1947) from a platonist perspective.
The following exposition follows this categorical approach.
Let E be an elementary topos with subobject classifier Œ© and natural numbers object N.
This says that no ordinal can be between œâ and P(œâ) in size.
The Cohen topos will be constructed from the topos Set of sets.
For this, recall that the subobject classifier of Set is 2‚âî{0,1}.
The technique of constructing such a topos is called forcing.
The dense Grothendieck topology on P is subcanonical.

Let k A√ó‚Ñï:{P‚ÜíSet p‚Ü¶A√ó‚Ñï denote the functor constant on A√ó‚Ñï.
Let Œ© denote the subobject classifier of Psh(P).
Let Œ© ¬¨¬¨ denote the subobject classifier of Sh(P,¬¨¬¨).
Recall that Œ© ¬¨¬¨ is given by the equalizer Œ© ¬¨¬¨=eq(id Œ©,¬¨¬¨).
The associated-sheaf functor sends g to a monomorphism in the Cohen topos.

Such a set of rules is called ‚Äúorganon of this or that science‚Äù.
In modern language this is the methodology? of a scientific discipline.
Kant then notes the difference between cognition a priori and transcendental cognition.
The former is merely any cognition obtained without recourse to intuition.
The latter is cognition concerning the possibility or use of cognition a priori.
A general criterion of truth found in general logic is self-contradictory.
Now general logic, as a putative organon, is called dialectic.‚Äù
For without intuition all of our cognition would lack objects and therefore remain completely empty.
The use of the pure understanding would in this case therefore be dialectical.
explains the transcendental deduction as follows:
Kant begins by describing the way in which the manifold of intuition is formed:
(B148) the categories are rules regarding how understanding may occur.
Such representations may be though of as states of the mind.
The word ‚Äùconcept‚Äú itself could already lead us to this remark.
The crucial point is this unity of consciousness.
Kant speaks also of a unity of rule that ‚Äúdetermines every manifold‚Äù.
When taking sets as object the rules should be some kind of relation.
This is to say for our cognition (Erkenntnis) thereof.
These are the pure concepts of the understanding we sought.
Further one should remark that a priori concepts are distinguished by their numerical unity.
Kant elaborates on this distinction in the next book.
The idea is to assign each moment of time, i.e. impression, a model.

Let F be the endofunctor F(X)=1+X.
Observe that T is an equivalence relation that contains S and therefore R.
Thus N is a natural numbers object.

So a smooth groupoid is a stack on the site CartSp.
But this is equivalently the groupoid of G-principal bundles on ‚Ñù n.

Here we make this explicit for basic electromagnetism.
For more exposition and details along these lines see (Eggersson 14).
However, not all different gauge potentials describe different physics.
And it is not quite a smooth space itself, but a smooth groupoid:
One says that Œª induces a gauge transformation from A to A‚Ä≤.
We write Œª:A‚Üí‚âÉA‚Ä≤ to reflect this.
So the configuration space of electromagnetism does not just have points and coordinate systems.
But it turns out that this is too little information to correctly capture physics.
This is the discrete gauge groupoid for U-parameterized collections of fields.
It refines the gauge group, which is recoverd as its fundamental group:

Recall the following definitions from differential topology.
In particular, the set of regular values is dense in N.
The notions of presheaf, site and sheaf can be formulated internal to any topos.
The ordinary such notions are recovered by internalization into Set.
This we spell out in Explicit definition.
(Also called an ‚Äúindexed functor‚Äù between indexed categories‚Äú.)
Suppose moreover that ‚ÑÇ is equipped with the structure of an internal site.
This yields a category PSh(‚ÑÇ) of internal presheaves.
Accordingly we have the full subcategory Sh(‚ÑÇ,ùíÆ)‚Ü™PSh(‚ÑÇ,ùíÆ) of internal sheaves.
We unwind what the above amounts to more explicitly.
Let ùíÆ ‚ÑÇ op be the topos of internal diagrams on ‚ÑÇ op.

Define a morphism (‚àí)‚àòœà(a):C(sp(a))‚ÜíC(X) by f‚Ü¶f‚àòœà(a).
This is a continuous *-algebra homomorphism.
Therefore so is the composite œï:C(sp(a))‚Üí(‚àí)‚àòœà(a)C(X)‚Üíœà ‚àí1‚ü®a‚ü©‚Ü™A.
And this satisfies œï(Œπ)=œà ‚àí1(Œπ‚àòœà(a))=œà ‚àí1œà(a)=a.
This establishes the existence of œï.

Here, we consider the linear situation.
These are: C ‚àû(N,E) is a convenient vector space.
The space C ‚àû(N,E) is a Fr√∂licher space and a vector space.
We want to know that these two structures are compatible.
Instead, we shall look for the weakest suitable topology.
Thus we are searching for a suitable family of linear functions C ‚àû(N,E)‚Üí‚Ñù.
This leads us to the definition of the family.
We start with œï‚ààE * and Œ±‚ààC ‚àû(‚Ñù,N).
These define a linear function C ‚àû(N,E)‚ÜíC ‚àû(‚Ñù,‚Ñù) by composition: g‚Ü¶œï‚àòg‚àòŒ±.
We write this dual as C ‚àû(N,E) *‚àû.
An immediate consequence of the construction is the following result.
Note that we say bounded and not continuous.
Neither of these is necessary for what we want to do, though.
Its associated Fr√∂licher space is C ‚àû(N,E).
We have to be careful here with where things are happening.
We consider a curve c:‚Ñù‚ÜíC ‚àû(N,E).
This curve defines a map cÀá:‚Ñù√óN‚ÜíE by cÀá(r,x)=c(r)(x).
Let us start by assuming that c is C ‚àû.
Hence the curve s‚Ü¶(œï‚àòc(s)‚àòŒ±) is a C ‚àû-map ‚Ñù‚ÜíC ‚àû(‚Ñù,‚Ñù).
Now let a:‚Ñù‚Üí‚Ñù√óN be a smooth curve.
As this holds for all a‚ààC ‚àû(‚Ñù√óN), cÀá:‚Ñù√óN‚ÜíE is smooth.
Thus c is a smooth map ‚Ñù‚ÜíC ‚àû(N,E).
Now let us assume that c is smooth.
Then the associated function cÀá:‚Ñù√óN‚ÜíE is smooth.
Now we transfer b^ to a smooth map b:‚Ñù‚ÜíC ‚àû(N,E).
It then follows that c‚Ä≤=b.
This shows that c is C ‚àû.
In the linear situation, we prefer to work with the bornologification of this topology.
In the smooth situation, we work with the curvaceous topology.
Let E be a convenient vector space.
Let U be a 0-neighbourhood in E in the c ‚àû-topology.
The c ‚àû-topology is the curvaceous topology.
This is the set {t‚àà‚Ñù:c(t)(N)‚äÜU}={t‚àà‚Ñù:c^(t,x)‚ààU‚àÄx‚ààN}
Now c^:‚Ñù√óN‚ÜíE is smooth and so c^ ‚àí1(U) is open in ‚Ñù√óN.
For this example, the topologies involved are all the ‚Äústandard‚Äù ones.
Hence the set {f:‚Ñù‚Üí‚Ñù:lvertf(t)rvert<1} is not a 0-neighbourhood.
This follows from the functorality of the C ‚àû(N,‚àí)-construction.

The strongest version of extensionality is motivated by the study of terminal coalgebras and coinduction.
Let S be equipped with a binary relation ‚â∫.
Thus, all forms of extensionality are equivalent for well-founded relations.
This implies that the type S is an h-set.
However, ‚â∫ is not strongly extensional.
Removing well-foundedness here gives a theory of ill-founded ordinal numbers.
Finally, on the set 2 again, let 1‚äÄ0 but all other relationships hold.
Then sets so equipped form a category with simulations as morphisms.
This leads to the model of sets equipped with extensional relations as transitive sets.

A field theory is very similar to a representation of a group.
how does topology enter?
Notice that dRRCob d(X) does depend covariantly on X.
This means that Fun ‚äó(RCob d(X),TopVect) is contravariant in X.
Instead, it is a map that comes from integration over fibers.
In particular it will change the degree of cohomology theories.
This point of view leads to extended topological quantum field theory.
Let G be a linearly ordered abelian group, and k a field.
Notationally, we may write a Hahn series f:G‚Üík as ‚àë x‚ààGf(x)t x.
The ring k[t G] is a field.
Well-based transseries can be constructed by iterating the Hahn series construction.

These equivalences are not difficult to establish.
A valuation ring O is a local ring.
Its maximal ideal is said to be the valuation ideal?.
Then (x+y)/y belongs to O as well.
It follows that non-unit elements of O are closed under addition.
A valuation ring O is integrally closed in its field of fractions F.
Examples such as these are often rich sources of rings and fields with infinitesimal elements.
The following example should give the flavor of this phenomenon.
This is called an ultrapower of the standard real numbers.
Again the finite hyperreals form a valuation ring sitting inside.
This totally ordered group is called the value group of the valuation ring O.
But this is precisely to say f is O(g) and g is O(f).
The order relation is that [f]O *‚â§[g]O * if f is O(g).

Dinatural transformations are a generalization of ordinary natural transformations and also of extranatural transformations.
The differences can be summarized thus:
Arguably, most dinatural transformations which arise in practice are ordinary or extranatural.
Let F,G:C op√óC‚ÜíD be functors.
Here we will confine ourselves to examples that do not reduce to either of these.
One such case is when certain squares are pushouts or pullbacks.
Of course, ordinary natural transformations can be composed.
Consider for example the bicategory Rel.
This bicategory admits a symmetric monoidal structure given by the cartesian product.
Here they are simply called 2-functors.
A transformation is strong if the structural cells Œ∏‚ãÖf are isomorphisms.
The triangular equations for L‚ä£R follow from the triangulator coherence conditions.
Let B be a 2-category.
If f:b‚Üíc is a map in B, then Œ∏‚ãÖf is invertible.
Eventually this article will be rewritten with this remark in mind‚Ä¶

We argue in a moment that these constraints are strong (adjoint) equivalences.
Now we check that the structural transformations Œ± are strong adjoint equivalences.
Similarly, each local hom-category carries a terminal object 1‚Üíhom(a,b).
We may summarize this by saying that cartesian bicategories are locally cartesian.
Now we show that these data actually determine the whole of the cartesian structure.
First, let us reconstruct ‚äó:B√óB‚ÜíB from the data above.
As an example, consider Œ¥r.
This completes the sketched proof of essential uniqueness.

We say the Frobenius condition holds if Frob b is an isomorphism for each b.

Write V//G for the corresponding action groupoid, itself a Lie groupoid.
The Lie algebroid Lie(V//G) corresponding to this is the action Lie algebroid.
To prepare the ground for this, the following observation recalls some basic facts.
The groupoid connection ‚àáœÉ on this patch is given by Œ© ‚Ä¢(U i)‚ÜêW(Lie(V//G)):‚àáœÉ i.
In degree 0 this is an algebra homomorphism C ‚àû(U i)‚ÜêC ‚àû(V):œÉ i.
This is the dual of the local section œÉ i itself.
We therefore write for short ‚àá (‚àí)œÉ i:=F ‚àásigma i 1

Ideally, we would like a condition equivalent to Œ¶ being a diffeomorphism.
Some conditions to consider are the following.
S‚äÜM is a submanifold if and only if Œ¶(S)‚äÜN is a submanifold.
So each object has its own family of test objects.
Closely related to this is the question of automorphisms of a category.
This extends more generally.
For cardinality reasons, Œ¶(U) cannot be zero dimensional everywhere.
Indeed, it can be zero dimensional at at most a countable number of points.
Choose a point p‚ààU such that dim Œ¶(p)Œ¶(U)‚â†0.
We choose an open set V with p‚ààV‚äÜV¬Ø‚äÜU.
By assumption, Œ¶(V) is a submanifold of ‚Ñù m and Œ¶(p)‚ààŒ¶(V).
Thus p must be an isolated point of Œ¶ ‚àí1(T).
Thus at those points where dimŒ¶(U)‚â†0, it must be of dimension m.
Suppose that there is such a point, say p.
Then Œ¶(p) is an isolated point from Œ¶(U).
Hence there cannot be any such points.
As the same holds for Œ¶ ‚àí1, we conclude that Œ¶ is a homeomorphism.
This is the generalization of the notion of over-category in ordinary category theory.

This degree 1 nonabelian cohomology classifies G-principal bundles.

These form the stabilization of H to a stable (‚àû,1)-category.
Two cocycles connected by a coboundary are cohomologous.
Notice that there is no notion of cochain in this general setup.

If A is at least an E 2 object, then H(X;A) is abelian.
What is called twisted cohomology is just the intrinsic cohomology of slice toposes.

For n>1 this special case happens to be actually abelian.
elliptic cohomology is somehow subsumed by cohomology with coefficients in tmf.
These are the sets of morphisms in the homotopy category H of ‚Ñã.

The intrinsic cohomology of such H is a nonabelian sheaf cohomology.
The space X itself is naturally identified with the terminal object X=*‚ààSh (‚àû,1)(X).
This is the petit topos incarnation of X.
This is HTT, theorem 7.1.0.1.

Suppose that X is a locally compact CW complex.
One can also identify its image as consisting of the locally constant (‚àû,1)-sheaves.
This is a homotopical version of the identification of covering spaces with locally constant sheaves.
This is discussed in detail in the section geometric realization at path ‚àû-groupoid.
twisted generalized cohomology theory is conjecturally ‚àû-categorical semantics of linear homotopy type theory:
Accordingly its derived functor is another way to think of H(X,A).
This is a very general definition.
These in turn correspond to extra properties of the ambient (‚àû,1)-category.

Let ùíû and ùíü be categories with pullbacks.
(This implies in particular that T preserves monos.)
A number of examples of taut functors can be deduced by applying the following observation.
Thus œï is an isomorphism, which completes the proof.
A similar proof shows that weakly cartesian natural transformations are also taut.
The ultrafilter endofunctor on Set is taut.
(See here for a proof that the ultrafilter functor preserves weak pullbacks.)
In fact, the ultrafilter monad is taut.
Similarly, the filter monad on Set is taut.
An analytic endofunctor induced by a species is taut.
In particular, an analytic monad is taut.
As an exception, we have
The double (contravariant) power set functor P‚àòP op:Set‚ÜíSet is not taut.
See chapter VI of his book.
This further induces an involution Mod(T)‚ÜíMod(T) on the category of models.
This involution (‚àí) op:Cat‚ÜíCat is also known as abstract duality.
More general still is a concrete duality induced by a dualizing object.
Nevertheless, many adjunctions come packaged in ‚Äúdual pairs‚Äù.
Such objects are known as dualizing objects.
In other words, it is an ideal in the lattice of closed subsets.

Hence basic localizers are a tool for homotopy theory modeled on category theory.
The definition is due to Grothendieck:
The term in French is localisateur fondamental, which is sometimes translated as fundamental localizer.
All this I believe is justification enough for the definition above.
This weaker notion is sometimes called a weak basic localizer.
The class of functors inducing an isomorphism on connected components is a basic localizer.
(These are the weak equivalences in the Thomason model structure.)
This includes all the previous examples.
(These are the weak equivalences of the canonical model structure.)
If W is a basic localizer, we define the following related classes.
We sometimes refer to functors in W as weak equivalences.
A category A is (W-)aspherical if A‚Üí1 is in W.
Thus the second axiom says exactly that any category with a terminal object is aspherical.
Thus the third axiom says exactly that every local weak equivalence is a weak equivalence.
We observe the following.
An aspherical functor is a weak equivalence.
If u has a right adjoint, then it is aspherical.
In particular, any left or right adjoint is a weak equivalence.
See Proposition 1.1.22 in (Maltsiniotis 05).
It follows that there is a unique smallest basic localizer.
The following was conjectured by Grothendieck and proven by Denis-Charles Cisinski.
A completely different proof is given in Corollaire 4.2.19 in (Cisinski 06)

of c, for each point x‚ààU‚à©D, we have f(x)‚ààV.
The two notions of limit can each be defined in terms of the other:
For c‚àâD, then the two definitions are equivalent.
These limits can be defined as limits of a filter:
We may generalize further from relations to spans.
In particular, limits of spans to a Hausdorff space are unique.
Limits of spans are no more general than limits of relations:
Finally, we may impose restrictions on the limit:
(In all of these, the French and English definitions agree.)
(For example, f(c +) is lim x‚Üícx>cf(x).)
Then this subset always exists; it just might be empty.
Sometimes a capitalized Lim is used to emphasize that this is now a set.
Again, we can add x‚ààC if we wish to take the limit in C.
Some basic relationships between the definitions are in the definitions section.
In this way, pointwise continuity may be defined using limits.
There is a Chain Rule for limits.

Of course, in a Boolean category, every object is decidable.
This is indeed the case, by this Prop..

In particular, this applies to commutative squares in a 1-category.
The same is true for double categories of adjunctions.
The same is true for more general arrangements in a double category of pullback squares.
The proof of this is not quite as trivial, but fairly straightforward.
In any fibrant double category, all arrangements can be composed.
The cartesian cells in a fibrant double category certainly allow such a factorization.

This is indeed the action of the left Quillen functor from above.

The following references discuss fundamental groupoids of an entire topos constructed from concrete interval objects.
Let X be a sufficiently nice topological space.
The etale space of LConst S is E(LConst S)=X√óS.
The general idea is that of Grothendieck's Galois theory.
I think this is proven in the literature, if maybe slightly implicitly so.
I‚Äôll now go through the available references to discuss this.
this is discussed in the context of Segal-toposes.
It represents the shape of the topos.
Write X also for X regarded as the terminal object in Sh (‚àû,1)(X).
Notice the local contractibility assumption.
This is necessary in general for Œ†(X) to make sense.
The quantity whose integral we are taking is the integrand.
The result of integrating the integrand is the value of the integral.
Many integrals are supposed to be inverse to differentiation procedures of various kinds.
Solving differential equations and constraints
One says that the equation is solvable in quadratures.
There is sometimes a relation to rational homotopy theory.
We list a bunch more notions of integration.

Further thunkable and linear morphisms form (non-full) subcategories ùíü t,ùíü l.

The pre-duploid ùíü has as objects |ùíü|=|C +|+|C ‚àí| with œñ(P)=+,œñ(N)=‚àí.
To define composition of f‚ààùíü(A,B),g‚ààùíü(B,C), we inspect B.
Intuitively, we want to recover the homomorphisms just from the heteromorphisms.
A divisor is called effective if all its coefficients are positive numbers.
Divisors arising this way are called principal divisors.
More generally in algebraic geometry this leads to the concept of Cartier divisor.
Two divisors are called linearly equivalent if their difference is a principal divisor.

Let X be a locally path connected space.
Then the path connected component P x‚äÇX over any point x‚ààX is an open set.
It follows by concatenation of paths that V y‚äÇP x.
This means that every path-connected component is also connected.
But by lemma these would be all open.
This would be in contradiction with the assumption that U is connected.
Hence we have a proof by contradiction.
(Euclidean space is locally path-connected)
(open subspace of locally path-connected space is locally path connected)
(circle is locally path-connected)
But these open intervals are locally path connected by example ,
in fact they are, evidently path-connected topological space.

Let X be a topological space and E‚ÜípX a covering space.
Write Œ† 1(X) for the fundamental groupoid of X.
Hence this defines a ‚Äúpermutation groupoid representation‚Äù of Œ† 1(X).
Now f‚àòŒ≥^ satisfies f‚àòŒ≥^(0)=f(x^) and p‚àòf‚àòŒ≥^=Œ≥ by the fact that f preserves fibers.

We obtain various kinds of lax promonoidal category by working in Prof instead of Cat.
If the identity is also representable, we obtain a (unital) closed category.

I began studying categories as a necessary foundation for mathematical physics and low dimensional topology.
Now they continually tempt me away from Hopf algebras, geometric combinatorics and knot concordance.

However, SGA I also considers the descent of affine schemes over a base scheme.
Let G be an abelian group.
And of course, from that follows: œÅ(x)>0 for all x‚â†0 in G.
A G-norm is a definite G-pseudonorm.
Except on the trivial group, this is not homogeneous.
It corresponds to the discrete metric on G.
However, different collections of G-pseudonorms may determine the same topological structure.
Conversely, let G be a TAG.

Binary groups are associative quasigroups, as they can be empty.
This contrasts with general geometric morphisms which are only bound to preserve geometric logic.

(‚áê) Now suppose T is substructure complete.
Fix œÜ(x) an ‚Ñí-formula.
Let d 1,‚Ä¶,d n be distinct new constant symbols.
Write d=d‚Üí=(d 1,‚Ä¶,d n).
(This is a structure in the language ‚Ñí of T, expanded by d.)
Let d A be the interpretation of the new constants d in A.
Proof of subclaim: this will be a standard compactness argument.
This means in particular that A‚äß‚ãÅ i=0 m¬¨Œ∏‚Ä≤ i(d A).
Since that disjunction is quantifier-free, it transfers down to C.
Therefore, there is some 0‚â§j‚â§m such that C‚äß¬¨Œ∏‚Ä≤ j(d A).
But for each j=1,‚Ä¶,m, Œ∏ j=Œ∏‚Ä≤ j(d A)‚ààDiag(C).
This proves the subclaim.
Now we proceed with proving the claim.
This proves the claim.
Now we proceed with proving the theorem.
Write œÜ *=df‚ãÅ i‚â§mœÜ i *.
Again, we generalize the constants d, obtaining T‚äß‚àÄx(œÜ‚áÜœÜ *).
By the above theorem, any theory which eliminates quantifiers is substructure complete.
Of course, substructure-completeness implies model-completeness.

Algebraic spaces are another example.

Property (2) is motivated because inclusion is transitive.
The really interesting property is property (3).
The opens form a sub-poset of the power set ùí´(‚Ñö√ó‚Ñö).
This poset is in fact a frame, as we will now show.
The bottom open, denoted ‚àÖ, is the binary relation ‚â•.
The same argument applies as before.
Finally, we must check the distributive law G‚à©‚ãÉ kH k‚äÜ‚ãÉ k(G‚à©H k).
In other words, we interpret ‚Äò‚äÜ‚Äô literally as comparing subsets of ‚Ñö.
It is straightforward to check that this condition does indeed define an open.
Notice that (a,b)=‚àÖ whenever a‚â•b.
We can actually generalise this somewhat.
If a<b, then a‚ààL or b‚ààU.
We have x‚àà‚Ñù since its lower and upper sets are inhabited.
(The converse, that x‚ààG and x‚ààH if x‚ààG‚à©H, is immediate.
We think of this condition as defining a closed set to which x does belong.
We also have that x‚àâ‚Ñù always fails, and x‚àâG‚à©H if x‚àâG or x‚àâH.
(I should check this.)
The proof is almost embarrassingly simple.
This is always a valid zigzag, so K=‚Ñù.
Therefore, the finite collection ùíü covers the unit interval.
So the Heine‚ÄìBorel theorem applies only to bounded closed intervals.
Defining functions in the locale of real numbers
Using the rational numbers
The first approach uses existing functions already defined on the rational numbers ‚Ñö.
Suppose that one has a locally uniformly continuous function f:‚Ñö‚Üí‚Ñö.

The other approach is via using existing functions defined on the Dedekind real numbers ‚Ñù.
That is to say, internal congruences in Def(T) are not generally effective.
This is sometimes called the coding of definable sets.
(Indeed, pretoposes are just toposes that might be missing some power objects.
If a first-order theory eliminates imaginaries, it interprets infinitely many constants.
In particular, when T eliminates imaginaries, its syntactic category has finite coproducts.
In particular, 2 exists, and all definable subsets have definable classifying maps.
The following characterization is due to Moshe Kamensky, and can be found here.
Let E‚áâtsX be a definable equivalence relation on X.
Let œï E:X√óX‚Üí2 classify E‚Ü™(s,t)X√óX.
Let y:Def(T)‚Ü™Def(T)^ be the Yoneda embedding.
Then yœï E has a product-exponential transpose yœï E¬Ø:yX‚Üí2 X.
By compactness, we can replace I with a finite subset I 0‚äÜI.
Since I is filtered, there exists a weak coproduct j to I 0.
On the other hand, suppose we have elimination of imaginaries.
The same proof works if we replace inner homs with power objects.
Let M‚äßT be a model.

This says that the fiber of P‚ÜíX over each point looks like the group G.
In its concrete incarnation as a stack, P is called a G-gerbe.
The fiber of such an ‚àû-bundle is the loop space object Œ©A.
The classifying morphism X‚ÜíA is then called a cocycle in nonabelian cohomology.
The typical fiber of such a 2-bundle looks like H.
This underlying object is the G-gerbe.
This is the general nonsense underlying the concept of gerbe.

The free category on the empty graph is the empty category.
For concreteness let us consider the topos of quivers.

Accordingly, one is interested in those categories for which every idempotent is split.
These are called idempotent complete categories or Cauchy complete categories.
Of course, we can simply consider the idempotent elements of any monoid.
Given an abelian monoid R, the idempotent elements form a submonoid Idem(R).

The category of ind-objects of ùíû is written ind-ùíû or Ind(ùíû).
Such large categories equivalent to ind-categories are therefore called accessible categories.

Picard-Vessiot theory is the Galois theory of homogeneous linear ordinary differential equations.
A version for homogeneous linear difference equations has also been developed.
Alternatively, terms differential Galois theory and difference Galois theory have also been used.

Sobolev spaces are particularly important in the theory of partial differential equations.
For this see the Exposition below.

This is called a discrete diagram.
This is also called the empty diagram.
The corresponding free diagrams (def. ) are called pairs of parallel morphisms.
They may be depicted like so: X aAAAAA‚ü∂f 2‚ü∂f 1X b.
These are called span diagrams.
They look as follows: X 0‚ü∂Af 0,1AX 1‚ü∂Af 1,2AX 2‚ü∂Af 2,3AX 3‚ü∂‚ãØ.
(solutions to equations are cones)
Consider the empty diagram (def. ).
The equalizer above is the space of all solutions of this equation.
Consider a cospan diagram (example ) Y ‚Üì f X ‚ü∂g Z.
Here is a more explicit description of the limiting cone over a diagram of sets:
We dicuss the proof of the first case.
The second is directly analogous.
First consider the case that the tip of a give cone is a singleton:
Such an A may be called a membership-inductive class.
In this form, the axiom of foundation is also called ‚àà-induction.
Two alternative formulations are given by the following lemmas: Lemma
Suppose that A does not contain all sets.
Then there exists an x 0‚àâA.
It arguably provides the most direct intuitive picture of what the axiom means.
(Such a y is called a membership-minimal element of x.)
So A satisfies the assumptions of the foundation axiom, and hence x is empty.
The ‚Äúonly if‚Äù direction of Lemma requires only excluded middle.

The category Ab serves as the basic enriching category in homological algebra.
Below in Monoidal and bimonoidal structure we put these structures into a more abstract context.
This is at the same time the direct sum A‚äïB.
See at tensor product of abelian groups for details.
A monoid internal to (Ab,‚äó,‚Ñ§) is equivalently a ring.
Categories enriched over Ab are called pre-additive categories or sometimes just additive categories.
If they satisfy an extra exactness condition they are called abelian categories.

Contents This is a sub-entry of Smooth‚àûGrpd.
We discuss the general abstract structures in a cohesive (‚àû,1)-topos realized in Smooth‚àûGrpd.
We discuss the intrinsic fundamental ‚àû-groupoid construction realized in Smooth‚àûGrpd.
Let first X‚ààSmoothMfd‚Ü™SmoothMfd Œî op be simplicially constant.
By the above proposition this is Œ† Etop applied to the underlying simplicial topological space.
The claim then follows with the corresponding proposition discussed at ETop‚àûGrpd.
We discuss the notion of geometric path ‚àû-groupoids realized in Smooth‚àûGrpd.
See Presentation of the path ‚àû-groupoid there.
We discuss cohesive ‚àû-groups in Smooth‚àûGrpd: smooth ‚àû-groups.
Let G be a Lie group.
Write BG‚ààSmooth‚àûGrpd for the corresponding delooping object.
We proceed by induction on n.
For the contractible Cartesian space all these cohomology groups vanish.
A simplicial group is possibly weak ‚àû-groupoid equipped with a strict group object structure.
We discuss the intrinsic cohomology and pricipal ‚àû-bundles in Smooth‚àûGrpd.
Let A‚àà ‚àûGrpd be any discrete ‚àû-groupoid.
Write |A|‚àà Top for its geometric realization.
The corresponding crossed module is [INN(G)]=(G‚ÜíIdG).
The evident projection P^‚ÜíP is objectwise a surjective and full and faithful functor.
This is a form of group cohomology for Lie groups.
This is (Brylinski, definition 1.1).
This shows the first claim, that BG‚Üê‚âÉ‚Üí‚âÉ‚à´ kŒî[k]‚ãÖC({U i k}).
Let X be a paracompact smooth manifold.
is equivalent to the groupoid of smooth G-principal bundles on X.
But also C(U)‚ÜíX is a cofibrant resolution.
This shows that the descent morphism in quesion is an isomorphism on œÄ 0.
Finally the isomorphism on œÄ 2 is clear.
See twisted bundle, twisted K-theory.
Analogous statements hold for ‚àû-Lie groups.
This is notably useful for finding smooth lifts of Whitehead towers.
Examples of this we discuss in the following.
Let O denote the orthogonal group, regarded as a Lie group.
We discuss steps of the Whitehead tower of O refined to ‚àûLieGrpd.
The smooth structure is that induced from O.
Here me may equivalently take thin homotopy-classes of paths and surfaces.
We discuss the intrinsic flat cohomology in Smooth‚àûGrpd.
Let A‚àà ‚àûGrpd be any ‚àû-groupoid and DiscA‚ààSmooth‚àûGrpd the coresponding discrete ‚àû-groupoid.
Recall the notation and model category presentations as discussed there.
where at the top we have the flat Deligne complex.
The inclusion U(1) const[n]‚ÜíU(1)[n] is not yet a fibration.
Let G be a Lie group regarded as a 0-truncated ‚àû-group in Smooth‚àûGrpd.
Write ùî§ for its Lie algebra.
Write BG‚ààSmooth‚àûGrpd for its delooping.
The canonical morphism of that into BG c is however not a fibration.
Similarly one sees that the map ‚ô≠BG c‚ÜíBG is a fibration.
We discuss the intrinsic de Rham cohomology in Smooth‚àûGrpd.
Recall the notation and model category presentations from the discussion there.
Hence the above hom-complex is indeed just ‚ãØ‚âÉ‚Ñù.
But B nU(1) is not cofibrant in [CartSp op,sSet] proj.
And face and degeneracy maps are the evident ones.
Write Q(B 1U(1))‚Üí‚âÉB nU(1) for the above cofibrant replacement.
The coboundary establishing this is given by setting Œ∫ U:=œâ U‚Üí*‚ÜíeU(1).
This establishes the theorem for n=1 and arbitrary k.
Let G be a Lie group.
Write ùî§ for its Lie algebra.
and composition is defined as follows (‚Ä¶)
There are many possible conventions.
We discuss here the intrinsic exponentiated ‚àû-Lie algebras in Smooth‚àûGrpd.
Write dgAlg for the category of dg-algebras over the real numbers ‚Ñù.
This is the category of L-‚àû algebras identified by their dual Chevalley-Eilenberg algebras.
We describe a presentation of the exponentiation an L-‚àû algebra to a smooth ‚àû-group.
The following somewhat technical definition serves to control the smooth structure on these exponentiated objects.
We write Œ© si ‚Ä¢(U√óŒî k) for this sub-dg-algebra.
For references related to this definition see Lie integration .
Then we have a smooth function f:Œî k‚àñK‚ÜíŒõ i k‚àñK.
We say that the loop space object Œ©exp(ùî§) is the smooth ‚àû-group exponentiating ùî§.
The objects exp(ùî§)‚ààSmooth‚àûGrpd are geometrically contractible: Œ†exp(ùî§)‚âÉ*.
We may think of Œ©exp(ùî§) as the smooth ‚àû-simply connected Lie integration of ùî§.
Notice however that Œ©exp(ùî§)‚ààSmooth‚àû in general has nontrivial and interesting categorical homotopy groups.
The above statement says that its geometric homotopy groups vanish .
The proof is spelled out at Lie integration.
We call this the line Lie n-algebra
We discuss the two morphisms in the composite separately in two lemmas.
But for our argument here it need not.)
It exhibits a smooth contraction of U.
(Notice that this step does not respect vertical forms.
Now let ùî§ be an ordinary Lie algebra.
Choose a dual basis {t a} and structue constants C a bc.
We get a discussion analogous to the above with structure constant terms thrown in:
By assumption, this is true at œÉ=0.
A solution to this differential equation with initial value 0 is F vu a=0.
Since this solution is guaranteed to be unique, we will have shown our claim.
For instance the structure constants now have components of arbitrary arity.
I‚Äôll try to think of a convenient notation to express this.
First we check that we have a morphism of simplicial sets over each U‚ààCartSp.
Therefore we have indeed objectwise a chain map.
Therefore it is an isomorphism on the homotopy groups in degree n.
Postcomposed with the integration map this is the operation œâ‚Ü¶‚à´ ‚àÇŒî kœâ.
Therefore we have indeed objectwise a chain map.
The canonical form on a Lie group Let G be a Lie group.
Write ùî§ for its Lie algebra.
Recall the discussion of B nU(1) and of ‚ô≠ dRB nU(1) from above.
Consider a function f:S‚ÜíT.
Consider a family f:‚àè (i:I)S(i)‚ÜíT(i) of functions.

This construction is also already interesting in extensional type theory.
The infinitesimal shape modality is the localization at the unique function ùíü‚Üíùüô.
The intersection of two causally closed sets is again a causally closed set.
The causal complement of a set may be empty.
Quantum information refers to data that can be physically stored in a quantum system.
we realize that the bracketing from above is essentially meaningless syntax.
Consider the interchange law from above, but replacing some of the arrows with identities.
Graphically, this means we can ‚Äúslide boxes‚Äù past each other.
A constructive proof can be found e.g. in BridgesVita.
The following is a generalisation to locally convex spaces: Bourbaki‚ÄìAlaoglu theorem?
See there for more background.
This proves the second claim on loop order.
Therefore Euler's formula (2) implies that that E(Œì‚Ä≤)=V(Œì‚Ä≤)‚àí1.
Of course, the coefficients are non-constant.

A Stonean locale is an extremally disconnected Stone locale.
The category of Stonean locales has open maps of locales as morphisms.
One can naturally think of a cospan as the abstraction of a cobordism.
This may require a bit more care with the topology involved.
I still need to check the reference below for more details.
On the blog the concept was mentioned in Urs Schreiber, (co)-traces
This is a version of G√∂del‚Äôs incompleteness theorem.
); the following are equivalent.
S admits all coproducts indexed by its own homsets.
S admits all products indexed by its own homsets.
Thus, it remains to prove that 2 implies 1.
So suppose that S admits coproducts indexed by its homsets.
Consider the ‚Äúglobal sections‚Äù functor Œì=S(1,‚àí):S‚ÜíSet.
Well-pointedness implies that this functor is faithful and conservative.
From now on we identify it with its essential image.
Let X‚ààS and suppose that Y‚äÇX is a subset of X.
Hence S is closed in Set under subsets.
A more direct proof of the corollary is possible.
We show as in the theorem that Œì is a full inclusion.
But since j x=j y, their pullback is also 1.
Since coproducts in a topos are stable under pullback, 1=‚àê XU x.
It is also locally small, complete and cocomplete.
In particular, the corollary fails to hold intuitionistically.
The difference of these two dimensions is the analytical index of the operator.
By topological K-theory one can associate to it also a topological index.
The Atiyah-Singer index theorem say that this two indexes coincide.
It is a rule which implies UIP as a theorem.
We denote path types by a= Ab and dependent path types by a= i.Ab.
Another synonym is (0,1)-category.
For more on this see at relation between preorders and (0,1)-categories.
A poset is a thin category.
In particular so are (semi)lattices, Heyting algebras and frames.
The crucial generalization is that the basic shapes here may have non-trivial automorphisms.
Let ùíû be a category with small limits and colimits.
See Joyal-Tierney calculus for more on these kinds of objects and morphisms.
Let S be a (Berger-Moerdijk)-generalized Reedy category.
Write [S,ùíû] for the category of presheaves on S op with values in ùíû.
We introduce the union of these categories over all objects of a fixed degree.
For n‚àà‚Ñï, let X‚àà[S,ùíû].
This is (Ber-Moer, lemma 6.2).
This is (Ber-Moer, lemma 6.3).
Clearly X itself is the inital such object.
With the above notation we have t k=t l‚àòq k.
Def. indeed defines a model structure.
It remains to show that the relevant lifting and factorization properties hold.
This we discuss in a list of lemmas below in Lifting and Factorization.
We work with the ‚Äúglobal‚Äù latching objects from above.
In the generalized Reedy structure, def. , the following holds.
This is (Ber-Moer, lemma 5.2, lemma 5.4).
We show the first clause.
Similarly Y 0‚ÜíX 0 is a fibration there.
One sees that this is indeed the fiber product as claimed.
We show this by induction over n, using the skeletal filtration def. .
This is (Ber-Moer, prop. 5.6).
Conversely, assume that all v n here are weak equivalences.
So assume now that all u k for k<n are weak equivalences.
Accordingly, so is u n, being its pushout.
Therefore, by induction, all u n are, in particular, weak equivalences.
The argument for fibrations is dual to this.
This is (Ber-Moer, page 18).
The other case (cofibration followed by acyclic fibration) works dually.
This is (Ber-Moer, lemma 6.4).
This is (Ber-Moer, prop. 6.5).
The case of coskeleta is dual.
By lemma it is sufficient to consider the case sk nX‚Üísk ‚àûX=X.
For k‚â§n, the horizontal morphisms are both isomorphisms.
Finally, that sk nX is cofibrant follows directly from lemma .
There is an obvious forgetful functor CCSG(C)‚ÜíC.
The category of pointed sets can also be given a cartesian monoidal structure.
Any Church monoid is a relevance monoidal category whose underlying category is a poset.
Therefore properly discontinuous actions are also called covering space actions (Hatcher).
Just as natural transformations go between functors, ananatural transformations go between anafunctors.
That is, a ‚Äònatural transformation‚Äô between anafunctors unambigously means an ananatural transformation.
Form the strict 2-pullback P‚âîF¬Ø√ó CG¬Ø and consider the strict functors P‚ÜíF¬Ø‚ÜíD and P‚ÜíG¬Ø‚ÜíD.
Of course, an ananatural isomorphism is an invertible ananatural transformation.
A ‚Äòminimum object‚Äô would be instead an initial object.
This is not the definition we take here!
Indeed, one might call ‚Ñ∞-minimal objects ‚Ñ≥-maximal.
We call these simply maximal objects.
Every category also admits (ùíû,‚Ñê) as a trivial orthogonal factorization system.
We call these simply minimal objects.
These notions recover the order-theoretic ones when ùíû is a preorder.
The following are equivalent: An object M:ùíû is ‚Ñ≥-minimal
Every morphism h:A‚ÜíM is in ‚Ñ∞.
Dually, the following are equivalent: An object M:ùíû is ‚Ñ≥-maximal
Every morphism h:M‚ÜíA is in ‚Ñ≥.
In fact, suppose ùíû has initial object 0 and suppose M:ùíû is minimal.
M:0‚ÜíM has to be an isomorphism, so that M‚âÖ0.
However, unlike in preorders, not all initial objects are minimal!
A minimal initial object is known as strict initial object.
A maximal terminal object is known as strict terminal object.
Let ùíû be a category equipped with an (‚Ñ∞,‚Ñ≥)-factorization system.
This category inherits the epi-mono factorization system from Set.
Let M,M‚Ä≤ be minimal in ùíû.
Then œÄ M:M√óM‚Ä≤‚ÜíM and œÄ M‚Ä≤:M√óM‚Ä≤‚ÜíM‚Ä≤ are both invertible, proving M‚âÖM√óM‚Ä≤‚âÖM‚Ä≤.
Let ùíû be a category with finite products.
Then if M is minimal it is weakly initial.
Let M:ùíû be such minimal object.
Let A be any other object in ùíû.
Then, by hypothesis on M, the projection œÄ M:M√óA‚ÜíM is invertible.
Notice we can‚Äôt say anything about the uniqueness of these morphisms w A:M‚ÜíA.
In general, they are not even functorially chosen.
It is this force that holds a piece of matter together.
Let ùíû be a category equipped with a notion of homotopy between its morphisms.
Both are reviewed in May 1967, Cor. 29.10.
Explicit description of the homotopy operator is given in Gonzalez-Diaz & Real 1999.
These are typically conceived as stacks: these are then called moduli stacks.
Typically these are demanded to be Deligne-Mumford stacks.

This is due to (Weiss 07).

This entry is about the notion of spans/correspondences which generalizes that of relations.
For spans in vector spaces or modules, see linear span.
(The word ‚Äúcorrespondence‚Äù is also sometimes used for a profunctor.)
A span that has a cocone is called a coquadrable span.
If the category C has pullbacks, we can compose spans.
Then Span 1(C) is a dagger category.
Next assume that C is a cartesian monoidal category.
We discuss the universal property that characterizes 2-categories of spans.
This is due to Hermida 1999.
(See also this MO discussion).
Relation to relations Correspondences may be seen as generalizations of relations.
See at relation and at Rel for more on this.
Under this identification composition of spans indeed corresponds to matrix multiplication.
The Weinstein symplectic category has as morphisms Lagrangian correspondences between symplectic manifolds.
More generally symplectic dual pairs are correspondences between Poisson manifolds.

In addition, the constructor for B can refer to the constructor for A.
Inductive-inductive types are related to inductive-recursive types.
Importantly, inductive-inductive types have an initial algebra semantics with respect to dialgebras.
Hugunin provides a reduction of an inductive-inductive type to an inductive type.
This construction is conjectured to generalize to all inductive-inductive types.
This is also called the generalized tangent bundle of X.
Dually one speaks of generalized homology.
Since this has different presentations, there are corresponding different versions of suitable axioms:
Notice however that ‚Äúclassical homotopy category‚Äù is already ambiguous.
Moreover, historically, these conditions have been decomposed in several numbers of ways.
Write Top CW */ for the corresponding category of pointed topological spaces.
Write Ab ‚Ñ§ for the category of integer-graded abelian groups.
We may rephrase this more intrinsically and more generally:
Let ùíû be an (‚àû,1)-category with (‚àû,1)-pushouts, and with a zero object 0‚ààùíû.
Write Œ£:ùíû‚Üíùíû:X‚Ü¶0‚äîX0 for the corresponding suspension (‚àû,1)-functor.
See at long exact sequence in generalized cohomology.
We identify Top CW‚Ü™Top CW ‚Ü™ by X‚Ü¶(X,‚àÖ).
We say E ‚Ä¢ is additive if it takes coproducts to products:
Hence the excision axiom implies E ‚Ä¢(X,B)‚ü∂‚âÉE ‚Ä¢(A,A‚à©B).
Conversely, suppose E ‚Ä¢ satisfies the alternative condition.
Let E ‚Ä¢ be an cohomology theory, def. , and let A‚Ü™X.
Consider U‚âî(Cone(A)‚àíA√ó{0})‚Ü™Cone(A), the cone on A minus the base A.
Define a reduced cohomology theory, def. (EÀú ‚Ä¢,œÉ) as follows.
This is clearly functorial.
By lemma we have an isomorphism EÀú ‚Ä¢(X‚à™Cone(A))=E ‚Ä¢(X‚à™Cone(A),{*})‚ü∂‚âÉE ‚Ä¢(X,A).
Let (EÀú ‚Ä¢,œÉ) be a reduced cohomology theory, def. .
For excision, it is sufficient to consider the alternative formulation of lemma .
For CW-inclusions, this follows immediately with lemma .
That however is isomorphic to the unreduced mapping cone of the original inclusion.
With this the natural isomorphism is given by lemma .
As before, this is isomorphic to the unreduced mapping cone of the point inclusion.
Finally we record the following basic relation between reduced and unreduced cohomology:
Hence this is a split exact sequence and the statement follows.
The first condition on a Brown functor holds by definition of H ‚Ä¢.
This means that the four lemma applies to this diagram.
Inspection shows that this implies the claim.
This entry is about pretopologies on sites.
Every Grothendieck pretopology generates a genuine Grothendieck topology.
Different pretopologies may give rise to the same topology.
See Definition II.1.3 in SGA 4. Definition
Let C be a category.
Every family consisting of a single isomorphism {V‚Üí‚âÖU} is a covering family;
However, many coverages that arise in practice are actually already Grothendieck pretopologies.
An example for the category Diff of manifolds is the pretopology of surjective submersions.
All of these have covering families consisting of single morphisms.
Recall that a cocycle on ùîû is a closed element in CE(ùîû).
more generally its differential is again in the shifted copy.
But the condition for an invariant polynomial is stronger than these ad-invariances.
Every decomposable invariant polynomial, def. , is horizontally equivalent to 0.
Therefore cs 1‚àßP 1 exhibits a horizontal equivalence P 1‚àßP 2‚àº0.
Horizontal equivalence classes of invariant polynomials on ùî§ form a graded vector space inv(ùî§) V.
By prop. it follows that inv(ùî§) V contains only indecomposable invariant polynomials.
Write ùî§ Œº 3 for the corresponding string Lie 2-algebra.
Now the indecomposable invariant polynomials are those of ùî§ and one additional one: g.
On reductive Lie algebras Proposition Let ùî§ be a reductive Lie algebra.
Let ùîû=ùî§ be an ‚àû-Lie algebra.

This element cs will in general not sit entirely in the shifted copy.
Its restriction Œº:=cs| ‚àß ‚Ä¢ùî§ *‚ààCE(ùî§) is a ‚àû-Lie algebra cocycle.

This is not true for either precategories or strict categories.
Thus, in this case precategories seem unavoidable.

An equivalence of categories is a fully faithful split essentially surjective functor.

ETCS : Building joins and coproducts
This is Part III of an exposition by Todd Trimble on ETCS.
But let‚Äôs see ‚Äî where were we?
(In the jargon, ETCS is a typed theory.)
These are some of the issues we discussed last time.
We started doing some of that in our last post.
(Talk about ‚Äúfoundations‚Äù!)
Enough philosophy for now; readers may refer to my earlier posts for more.
Let‚Äôs get to work, shall we?
In this post we will focus on coproducts.
Let E be an ETCS category (see here for the ETCS axioms).
If an ETCS category E is a preorder, then E is degenerate.
Every morphism in a preorder is vacuously monic.
Therefore all objects A are terminal.
‚ñ° Assume from now on that E is a nondegenerate ETCS category.
By strong extensionality, there exists x:1‚ÜíU distinguishing these classifying maps.
Let 0‚Üí1 denote this subset.
The classifying map 1‚ÜíP1 of 0‚äÜ1 is the truth value we call ‚Äúfalse‚Äù.
‚ñ° Corollary 1. For any X, the set 0√óX is initial.
If there exists f:X‚Üí0, then X is initial.
Hence X is isomorphic to an initial object 0√óX. ‚ñ°
If X¬¨‚âÖ0, then there exists an element x:1‚ÜíX.
As in ordinary set theory, we will construct these as disjoint unions.
So, let A,B‚äÜX be subsets.
Externally, in terms of subsets, this corresponds to the condition U√óA‚äÜ[C].
We need to construct the subsets {C‚ààPX:A‚äÜC},{C‚ààPX:B‚äÜC}.
Let me take a moment to examine what this diagram means exactly.
Here is a useful general principle for doing internal logic calculations.
Now apply Lemma 2 to complete the proof.
By the adjunction, the inequality (*) implies (y‚áíb)‚â§(x‚áíb). ‚ñ°
(Actually, we need only show A‚äÜ‚ãÇ{C‚ààPX:A‚äÜC}.
We‚Äôll do that first, and then show full equality.)
So we just have to prove (1).
We are required to show that {x‚ààX:‚àÄ S‚ààPX(A‚äÜS‚àßB‚äÜS)‚áíx‚àà XS}‚äÜC.
We will use the notation X+Y for a disjoint union.
So this equalizer E is empty.
But notice that ‚ü®h,1‚ü©:A‚ÜíX√óA equalizes this pair of maps.
Therefore we have a map A‚ÜíE‚âÖ0.
By Corollary 2 above, we infer A‚âÖ0.
Any two disjoint unions of X,Y are canonically isomorphic.
Suppose i:X‚ÜíZ‚ÜêY:j is a disjoint union.
Next, we show that œï is monic.
Therefore i‚äÜ¬¨cj‚äÜ¬¨c where ¬¨=(‚àí‚áí0):Sub(Z)‚ÜíSub(Z) is the negation operator.
This contradicts the assumption that the topos is nondegenerate.
Thus we have shown that œï must be monic.
The proof is now complete.
Let f:X‚ÜíB, g:Y‚ÜíB be given functions.
Hence h:X+Y‚ÜíB extends f and g.
I think that‚Äôs enough for one day.
I will continue to explore the categorical structure and logic of ETCS next time.
One way to see the isomorphism Spin(6)‚âÖSU(4) is as follows.
Since SU(V) is connected we in fact have œÅ:SU(V)‚ÜíSO(Œõ + 2V).
Since dœÅ is nonzero and SU(4) is simple, dœÅ must be injective.
Since dim(SU(4))=15=dim(SO(6)), dœÅ must also be surjective.
Thus SU(4) is a double cover of SO(6), and SU(4)‚âÖSpin(6).
An algebraic group is linear iff it is affine.
An algebraic group scheme is affine if the underlying scheme is affine.

Accordingly, we will speak of homotopy van Kampen theorems and strict van Kampen theorems.
We can regard the classical theorem as being a statement about fundamental groupoids as follows.
But we can easily make it a strict van Kampen theorem as well.
This strict pushout is therefore equivalent to Œ† 1(X‚Ä≤).
This becomes evident when generalizing to higher homotopy van Kampen theorems.
Note that the theorem about groupoids does not reduce to a theorem about groups.
In certain situations, strict colimits of groupoids are also 2-colimits.
We can then prove the theorem by proving each of these three parts separately.

This entry is about tangent vectors on differentiable manifolds and the bundle they form.
For the tangent function see there.
A tangent vector field on X is a section of TX.
Below we give first the traditional definitions in ordinary differential geometry.
(tangency is equivalence relation)
The two relations in def. are equivalence relations and they coincide.
Finally, that either relation is an equivalence relation is immediate.
Let X be a differentiable manifold and x‚ààX a point.
The set of all tangent vectors at x‚ààX is denoted T xX.
In summary this makes TX‚ÜíX a differentiable vector bundle.
We need to produce disjoint openneighbourhoods of these points in TX.
Now to see that TX is paracompact.
Let {U i‚äÇTX} i‚ààI be an open cover.
We need to find a locally finite refinement.
That this is an open cover refining the original one is clear.
We need to see that it is locally finite.
So let (x,v‚Üí)‚ààTX.
This shows that TX is paracompact.
For more on this see at derivations of smooth functions are vector fields.
See Newns-Walker 56. In synthetic differential geometry
This definition captures elegantly and usefully the notion of tangent vectors as infinitesimal curves.
Objects X for which this is true are microlinear spaces in ùíØ.

The quotient of an effective congruence is called an effective quotient.
Every kernel pair is a congruence.
An equivalence relation is precisely a congruence in Set.

Idea Equivariant ordinary cohomology is the equivariant cohomology-version of ordinary cohomology.
Hence the one concept more fundamental than stable Cohomotopy theory is actual Cohomotopy theory.
(see SS 19, p. 9-10)
This is the tip of an iceberg.
Which needs to be discussed elsewhere.
However, the difference between reduced and unreduced Cohomotopy is small:
This construction generalizes to equivariant cohomotopy, see there.
Further, the (‚àí1)-sphere is understood as the empty space.
In the context of homotopy type theory, this is the same as negation.
Let X be a 4-manifold which is connected and oriented.

This is a subsection of the entry cohesive (‚àû,1)-topos.
See there for background and context.
We speak of differential cohesion.
See also the section Infinitesimal thickening at Q-category.
This implies that also i * is a full and faithful (‚àû,1)-functor.
Moreover i * is necessarily a full and faithful (‚àû,1)-functor.
We give a presentation of classes of infinitesimal neighbourhoods by simplicial presheaves on suitable sites.
Let C be an ‚àû-cohesive site.
We first check that (‚àí)‚àòi sends locally fibrant objects to locally fibrant objects.
To that end, let {U i‚ÜíU} be a covering family in C.
This establishes the quadruple of adjoint (‚àû,1)-functors as claimed.
It remains to see that i ! is full and faithful.
These structures parallel the structures in a general cohesive (‚àû,1)-topos.
We say that ‚Ñú is the reduction modality.
‚Ñë is the infinitesimal shape modality.
& is the infinitesimal flat modality.
‚Ñú(X) is the reduced cohesive ‚àû-groupoid underlying X.
See the section Formal smoothness at Q-category for more discussion.
Therefore we have the following more general definition.
f is a formally unramified morphism if this is a (-1)-truncated morphism.
An order-(-2) formally unramified morphism is equivalently a formally √©tale morphism.
Even more generally we can formulate formal smoothness in H th: Definition
Every equivalence is formally √©tale.
The composite of two formally √©tale morphisms is itself formally √©tale.
Any retract of a formally √©tale morphisms is itself formally √©tale.
The first statement follows since ‚àû-pullbacks are well defined up to quivalence.
If f and g are formally √©tale then both small squares are pullback squares.
This implies the fourth claim.
Hence p is formally √©tale.
This is discuss in cohesive (‚àû,1)-topos ‚Äì structure ‚àû-sheaves.
As such it is in particular an effective epimorphism.
For more see at Lie differentiation.
One way to motivate this is to consider structure sheaves of flat differential forms.
The following proposition establishes that this coreflection indeed exists.
Hence the embedding is a geometric embedding which exhibits a sub-(‚àû,1)-topos inclusion.
We call ùí™ X the structure sheaf of X.
We need to show that also Et(X√óp) is a 1-epimorphism.
we may call the G-valued flat cotangent sheaf of X.
Here L is the reflector from prop. .

For this reason, they are not the fibrations in any model structure on Cat.

Fibrations are employed in type theory as the categorical models of dependent types.
Moreover, the distinction between the two is appreciable.

Hence knowing this space tells us about the space of conjugacy classes of unitary matrices.
In particular, SP 2(S 1) is a M√∂bius strip.
This is a homeomorphism onto its image.
This space is relevant because the construction SP n(‚àí) respects homotopy equivalences.
The space SP n(S 1) is Hausdorff.
It embeds in the Hausdorff space SP n(‚ÑÇ *).
There is another map which is worth mentioning.
Now let us prove the proposition.
Let us show that this is a fibre bundle.
To do this, we consider the exponential map SP n(‚Ñù)‚ÜíSP n(S 1).

Introducing the 4d TQFT Walker-Wang model:
This generalizes the notion of tangent space of a differentiable manifold.
Generalised smooth spaces are, as the name suggests, generalisations of smooth manifolds.
They share many common properties and constructions with manifolds.
One of the most basic constructions applied to manifolds is that of the tangent space.
In particular, it may not even be a vector space.
However, it will always be a kind of partial vector space.
It is also possible to define ‚Äúhigher‚Äù kinematic tangent spaces.
However, for more general spaces it can provide more tangent vectors.
But there are curves Œ± with Œ±(0)=0 and Œ±‚Ä≤(0)=0 but Œ±‚Ä≥(0)‚â†0.
These curves define a tangent vector that ‚Äúsees‚Äù the inward direction from 0.
Let X be a smooth space.
Let x‚ààX be a point.
As mentioned in the introduction, this need not be a vector space.
However, it will always have some of the structure of a vector space.
What fails is the existence of a globally defined addition.
It follows from the definition that if u+v exists, it is unique.
This is because all of our categories are cocomplete and cartesian closed.
With this in mind, we can define higher level kinematic tangent spaces.
Let X be a smooth space.
Let x‚ààX be a point.
The kth kinematic tangent bundle is defined similarly.
This defines a diagram indexed by the poset ‚Ñï with divisibility as the order.
The structure of the higher kinematic tangent spaces is somewhat complicated.
In the following we shall concentrate on the first kinematic tangent space.
Let X,Y be smooth spaces.
There is a natural isomorphism T(X√óY)‚ÜíTX√óTY.
Together with the other projection, we get a map: T(X√óY)‚ÜíTX√óTY.
For the other direction, we need to consider curves.
Let f:X√óY‚Üí‚Ñù be a smooth function.
As this map is smooth, its derivative agrees with the vector of partial derivatives.
That is to say, we compute the derivative of: s‚Ü¶f(Œ±(s),Œ≤(0)).
Then the above function agrees with g‚àòŒ±.
From this we see that the map T(X√óY)‚ÜíTX√óTY is injective.
For this, we use the natural isomorphism C ‚àû(‚Ñù,X)√óC ‚àû(‚Ñù,Y)‚âÖC ‚àû(‚Ñù,X√óY.
For mapping spaces, we have an obvious map in one direction.
A tangent vector at a map is an infinitesimal deformation of that map.
Evaluation yields deformations at each point which fit together to give a family of deformations.

For each b‚ààU, there is some a‚ààU such that a<b.
An extended Dedekind cut is bounded if instead L and U are both inhabited.
The bounded cuts are the usual Dedekind cuts that represent real numbers.
So the only change is that we no longer require this boundedness condition.
The space of extended real numbers in this sense is often denoted ‚Ñù¬Ø.
Geometrically, this is a line segment?, the extended real number line segment.
This naturally defines the sort of extended real number in which ‚àû=‚àí‚àû.
(By ‚â† we mean the usual apartness relation on real numbers.)
The nontrivial ratios a‚à∂0 for a‚â†0 are all equivalent and represent ‚àû.
(The ratio 0‚à∂0 is considered trivial and does not represent any extended real number.
If we want to include it, then we get a wheel.)
Geometrically, this is a circle, the extended real number circle.
We can put a linear order on ‚Ñù¬Ø by setting ‚àí‚àû<x<‚àû for any real number x.
(These orders can be defined constructively too, with a little more work.)
Of course, ‚àû and ‚àí‚àû are opposites (additive inverses).
These are all straightforward extensions of the usual definition of addition for Dedekind cuts.
Now ‚àû is its own opposite.
These all agree with the additive rule (a‚à∂b)+(c‚à∂d)=(ad+bc‚à∂bd).
(This continues to work even if x is infinite too.)
But now 0‚ãÖ¬±‚àû is undefined.
(With 0‚ãÖ1=0‚ãÖ2 and ‚àû‚ãÖ1=‚àû‚ãÖ2, multiplication is not cancellative either.)
The definitions as phrased above give us located extended real numbers.

This appears as theorem 1 in Caramello (2009).
This appears as proposition 6.2 in Caramello (2012a).
Sh m(‚Ñ∞)=‚Ñ∞ iff ‚Ñ∞ is a De Morgan topos.
Accordingly, dense inclusions Sh j(‚Ñ∞)‚Ü™‚Ñ∞ are m-skeletal !
Conversely, assume all ‚Ñ±‚Üí‚Ñ∞ are m-skeletal.
But Œ≥‚Ñ∞ is De Morgan and, therefore, so is im(f)=‚Ñ∞.

R V,W is always fullfilled if both V and W are finite dimensional.

A cardinal that is not regular is called singular.
Traditionally, one requires regular cardinals to be infinite.
Set <Œ∫ is closed under iterated disjoint unions (‚®Ñ iA i).
Set <Œ∫ is closed under binary disjoint unions (A‚äéB).
These are all variations on the theme of closure under disjoint unions.

However, there is also a different notion of Witt group? and Witt ring.
Rings of Witt vectors are the co-free Lambda-rings.
For more on this see at arithmetic jet space and at Borger's absolute geometry.
The multiplication is defined by means of Witt polynomials w i for every natural number i.
Hence rings of Witt vectors are the co-free Lambda-rings.
Moreover W(‚àí) is representable by ring of symmetric functions, Œõ.
The reason is that Œõ is the free Lambda-ring on the commutative ring ‚Ñ§.
Since Œõ is a Hopf algebra, W is a group scheme.
This is explained at Lambda-ring.
Elements from this set are called Teichm√ºller digits or Teichm√ºller representatives.
The set T is in bijection with the finite field F p.

The first thing we need to do is make sure that such polynomials exist.
We have an induced injective map W(A)‚ÜíW(A‚äó‚Ñö).
Lastly, we need to prove this for positive characteristic rings.
Choose a characteristic 0 ring that surjects onto A, say B‚ÜíA.
Hence rings of Witt-vectors are the co-free Lambda-rings.
This statement appears in (Hazewinkel 08, p. 87, p. 97).

Every precategory is a locally univalent E-category.
In univalent type theory there is a structure identity principle?

We claim that œï is smooth.
But that is the case since ddr(exp(1r 2‚àí1))=‚àí2r(r 2‚àí1) 2exp(1r 2‚àí1).

It follows that every abelian category is a balanced category.
In an abelian category, pullback preserves epimorphisms and pushout preserves monomorphisms.

Let U:C‚ÜíD be a forgetful functor and x‚ààD an object of the category D.

It also follows that U is a Grothendieck fibration and opfibration.
Since initial lifts have a universal property, they are unique up to unique isomorphism.
This is tantamount to deciding that U should be an amnestic functor.
Outside of topology, the category of measurable spaces is topological over Set.
If D is complete or cocomplete, then so is C.
If D is total or cototal, then so is C; see solid functor.
If D is mono-complete or epi-cocomplete, then so is C.
This generalizes the lifting of orthogonal factorization systems along Grothendieck fibrations.
If D is concrete, then so is C.
More generally, if D has a generator, then C is concrete over D.
It preserves final lifts iff it is left adjoint.
Similarly, we have an indiscrete space with the final structure induced by no maps.
Suppose that D has an initial object 0 D.
Then the discrete space 0 C over 0 D is initial in C.
Similarly, the indiscrete space over a terminal object in D is terminal in C.
More general limits and colimits are constructed in a similar way.
Exploiting this shows how to construct final structures out of initial ones and conversely.

This concept of orbifold cohomology does fully reflect the geometric nature of orbifolds.
It also reflects some equivariance aspect.
However, this definition does not reflect Bredon-equivariant cohomology around the orbifold singularities.
The following may serve as intuition for the issue with the nature of orbifolds:
This is the plain quotient *=*/G.
Its intrinsic cohomology accomodates a good notion of orbifold cohomology (SaSc 2020).
The same lecture also introduced motivic integration.
For global quotient orbifolds this is the topological quotient space X/G.
Each of these categories is also commonly denoted Man or Mfd or Diff etc.

We explain what this means from right to left.
The (‚àû,1)-category Sh(ùí¢) is called an ‚àû-stack (‚àû,1)-topos.
Every ‚àû-stack (‚àû,1)-topos has a hypercompletion to one of this form.
This discussion here is glossing over all set-theoretic size issues.
See StSp, warning 2.4.5.
This yields an (‚àû,1)-functor ùí™:ùí¢‚Üíùí≥.
This is canonically equipped with a (‚àû,1)-functor ùí™ SpecX:ùí¢‚ÜíSpecX.

An additive category is a category which is an Ab-enriched category;
The natural morphisms between additive categories are additive functors.
A pre-abelian category is an additive category which also has kernels and cokernels.

Note that the entire Ab-enriched structure follows automatically for abelian categories.
Consider first the nullary (i.e., zero-ary) case.
Consider now the case of binary (co-)products.
Observe some basic compatibility of the Ab-enrichment with the product:
This means that X 1√óX 2 satisfies the universal property of a coproduct.
By induction, this implies the statement for all finite (co-)products.
With respect to this operation, composition is bilinear.

Action groupoid presents the quotient stack [M/G].
Source and target are end points of a path.
Multiplication is concatenation of paths (think why associative?).
The problem for this groupoid is that it might not be a Lie groupoid.

In physics, the term ‚Äúmultiverse‚Äù refers to certain picture of cosmology.

Therefore it is important to distinguish the observable universe from the universe as such.
Generically Kaluza-Klein theories have this property, and in particular string theory does.
Only improved mathematical understanding of the theory will eventually be able to tell.
I am skeptical about this claim.
That is why none of the claims made by multiverse enthusiasts can be directly substantiated.
But we have no hope of testing it observationally.
All in all, the case for the multiverse is inconclusive.
Most proposals involve a patchwork of different ideas rather than a coherent whole.
Although they can be fitted together, there is nothing inevitable about it.
But we should name it for what it is.
It is a delicate path to tread.
We are going to have to live with that uncertainty.
Nothing is wrong with scientifically based philosophical speculation, which is what multiverse proposals are.

There are two different attitudes to what a desirable or interesting foundation should achieve:
The archetypical such system is ZFC set theory.
For a philosophical treatment of foundations see foundations and philosophy.
Almost all foundations of mathematics are expressed in some foundational deductive system.
Objects could be referred to as element or term.
In SEAR and structural ZFC, sets and elements are both basic distinct notions.
In type theory, there are also a distinction to be made.
In most type theories, both terms and types are basic foundational notions.
Formally, there are also a difference in the contexts.
Judgmental equality is defined as a basic judgment in the foundations.
Propositional equality is defined as a proposition in any typed predicate logic.
The equality of elements used in dependent type theories are typal equality.
The equality of collections differs from theory to theory.
Thus, any unsorted set theory like fully formal ETCS violates the principle of equivalence.
However, there is a way around it, by the usage of universes.
Each foundations of mathematics has their own approach to universes:
This is not quite so.

We work with binary relations on the power set P(X) of a set X.
Nullary additivity: it is always true that A‚ãà‚àÖ and ‚àÖ‚ãàA for any A.
Similarly, in terms of ‚â™ we obtain a topogenous order or topogenous neighborhood relation:
Nullary additivity: it is always true that A‚â™X and ‚àÖ‚â™A for any A.
(With topogenies, we can just take the union, period.)
The opposite relation of a topogenous relation is again topogenous.
Of course, a symmetric perfect topogenous relation is automatically biperfect.
When X is equipped with a syntopogeny, it is called a syntopogenous space.
This defines the category STpg.
Thus, STpg‚ÜíSet is a topological concrete category.
This is a basis for a simple perfect syntopogeny.
Conversely, any binary relation on X containing the diagonal defines a biperfect topogenous relation.
(For a biperfect topogeny, remove the requirement that U contain the diagonal.)
Constructively, this equivalence still holds for both nearness and neighborhood syntopogenous spaces.
Syntopogenous apartness spaces, on the other hand, correspond to uniform apartness spaces.
Thus, the intersection Top‚à©QUnif inside STpg is equivalent to Preord.

We will compare this intrinsic definition with more concrete models:
Definition A diffeological space is a concrete sheaf on the site CartSp smooth.
Write DiffeolSpace‚Ü™Sh(CartSp) for the full subcategory on diffeological spaces.
Notice that is a quasitopos.
A diffeological groupoid is an internal groupoid in the category of diffeological spaces.
Concrete smooth 0-groupoids are equivalently diffeological spaces.
This is equivalent to the category of diffeological spaces DiffeolSp‚âÉConc(œÑ ‚â§0Smooth‚àûGrpd).
Proof Let X‚ààSh(CartSp)‚Ü™Smooth‚àûGrpd be a sheaf on CartSp.
this is indeed the defining condition for concrete sheaves that defines diffeological spaces.
We want to say the following
Let A be 1-truncated and concrete.
both A 0 and A 1 are diffeological spaces.
Hence the above exhibits A as equivalent to a diffeological groupoid.

By construction the difference BÀú‚àíB‚Ä≤| ‚àÇŒî 3 has vanishing surface integral.
Together with our extension f‚Ä≤, this constitutes a pair that solves the lifting problem.
The following proof makes use of details discussed at differential string structure ‚Äì proofs .
We discuss that the first morphism is an equivalence.
Since the curvature H is horizontal it is already extended.
We now check that the second morphism is a fibration.
Therefore it is sufficient to show that the first morphism here is a fibration.
H has to be horizontal so it is to be constantly extended along the cylinder.

Idea A tricategory is a particular algebraic notion of weak 3-category.
The monoidal product is given by tensor product over R.
There is no predefined notion of equality of anything.
We also impose Axiom 1+Œµ (Choice operator)
Note that we have no notion of equality for arbitrary operations between pre-sets.
Axioms 3, 4, and 5 are easy to translate.
We call this theory SEAR+Œµ.
With this interpretation axiom 1+Œµ is precisely the SEAR-C axiom of choice.
The question is whether we can get SEAR+Œµ without assuming or implying choice.
Our goal is to prove that SEAR+Œµ is conservative over SEAR.
Suppose we have a model of SEAR satisfying COSHEP, call it V.
We define a model of SEAR+Œµ as follows.
The pre-sets are the projective V-sets.
The elements are the V-elements.
The pre-relations are the V-relations.
The operations are the V-functions.
Axiom 0 of SEAR+Œµ is obviously true.
I claim that in fact these functors are essentially surjective as well.
Thus, we have constructed a model of SEAR+Œµ.
Furthermore, its underlying SEAR-model is equivalent to V.
This is the conservativity result we were looking for.
(Of course, SEAR is capable of using this method too.)
Ah, you‚Äôre right.
Suppose f:A‚áùB is an operation.
Of course, as you point out, this is very impredicative.
The same argument as above should show that CSEAR+Œµ is conservative over CSEAR+COSHEP.
Now: is CSEAR+Œµ conservative over CSEAR?

Even if they do, sometimes the cofibrations are intractable in practice.
It turns out that this is sufficient for many useful constructions.
This makes categories of fibrant objects useful in homotopical cohomology theory.
Those morphisms which are both weak equivalences and fibrations are called acyclic fibrations .
Hence [œÉ 0,X], being its right inverse, is a weak equivalence.
One checks that this is indeed a Kan fibration.
The points of this topos precisely correspond to the ordinary points of X.

Compare also the notion of anafunctor.
The universal bundle terminology is best understood from the following example Example
For G an ordinary group write BG for the corresponding groupoid.
Let *:*‚ÜíBG be the unique morphism from the point into BG.
The morphism p f:E fB‚ÜíB is a fibration.
Both squares are pullback squares.
Since pullbacks of fibrations are fibrations, the morphism E fB‚ÜíC√óB is a fibration.
Therefore it is itself a fibration.
But it follows from the axioms that weak equivalences are preserved under pullback along fibrations.
This we establish in two lemmas.
The same reasoning applies for f‚ààW‚à©F.
The top two vertical composite morphisms are identities.
The pullback of a weak equivalence along a fibration is again a weak equivalence.
By the preceding lemma , so is g.
If v:B‚ÜíC is a weak equivalence, then this is an acyclic fibration.
One may compute this limit in terms of two consecutive pullbacks in two different ways.
The first claim follows then since fibrations are stable under pullback.
For that we need the following to lemmas. Lemma
By 2-out-of-3 it follows that it is also a weak equivalence.
Right homotopy f‚âÉg between morphisms is preserved under pre- and postcomposition with a given morphism.
More precisely, let f,g:B‚ÜíC be two homotopic morphisms.
The first of these follows trivially.
The second point is more work.
Let Œ∑:A‚ÜíC I the right homotopy in question.
It follows by 2-out-of-3 that the latter is a weak equivalence.
Factoring this using the factorization lemma produces hence B‚Üí‚ààWD‚Ä≤‚Üí‚ààW‚à©FD.
Finally, by setting A‚Ä≤=A√ó DD‚Ä≤ we obtaine the desired right homotopy f‚àòt‚Ä≤‚âÉg‚àòt‚Ä≤.
The nontrivial part is to show transitivity.
Using acyclic fibrations has the advantage that these are preserved under pullback.
This allows to consistently compose spans whose left leg is an acyclic fibration by pullback.
See also the discussion at anafunctor.
We now provide the missing definitions and then the proof of this theorem.
The homotopy categories of C and œÄC coincide: Ho C‚âÉHo œÄC. Proof

Free ultrafilters on Boolean algebras are important in nonstandard analysis and model theory.
Equivalently, a filterbase is any downward-directed subset.
Let f *(F) be the filter generated by this filter base.
Therefore L‚Ü¶Filters(L),f‚Ü¶f * is a functor from the category of posets to itself.
If f is merely monotone, then f * respects all filtered joins.
If f respects |I|-fold joins, then f * respects |I|-fold meets.
If f respects all joins, then f * respects all meets.
As a left adjoint f * respects all joins.
Note that the push-forward turns left adjoints into right adjoint and vice versa.

But most statements and constructions have straightforward generalizations to arbitrary bases.

We may think of it as the standard point equipped with a cohesive neighbourhood .
The detailed discussion is at ‚àû-cohesive site.

We establish this via a presentation of H by a model structure on simplicial presheaves.
Let then sSet +/A denote the model structure for left fibrations.

Finally this implies the claim using this proposition.
With this lemma we can now give the proof of prop. .

This algebra is in fact the Hecke algebra.
Let ùîª‚àà‚Ñ∞ be an internal site.
This is reviewed for instance in (Johnstone, p. 596).
The notation is motivated from the following example.
This is equivalently a group in Set equipped with a G-action.
Its internal delooping gives the internal groupoid ùîª:=‚Ñ¨H in ‚Ñ∞.
This appears as (Johnstone, lemma C2.5.3).
This result generalizes straightforwardly to an analogous statement for internal sheaves.
This appears as (Johnstone, prop. C2.5.4).
Evidence for this also comes from the details of the AdS/CFT mechanism.
Below at Examples we list some systems for which something along these lines is known.
The space of all suitable functionals satisfying these identities is the space of conformal blocks.
If so, we say that A is a holographic dual to B.
Under holography, the states of A are identified with the correlators of B.

What should a set be?
In a pure material set theory like ZFC, every object is a set.
What is a set?
We still need to clarify exactly what sort of collection a set is.
A category that is merely discrete and skeletal may be called a class instead.
A category that is merely small and discrete may be called a setoid instead.
(There are numerous other equivalent definitions; see h-set.)
Regarding types as ‚àû-groupoids, this definition takes care only of the discreteness requirement.
We freely allow ourselves to reason classically and use the principle of excluded middle.
We‚Äôll call such maps continuous, for short.
If x‚â§f(x) for all x‚ààœâ 1, then we say that f is inflationary.
Suppose f:œâ 1‚Üíœâ 1 is inflationary and continuous.
Then every x‚ààœâ 1 has an upper bound that is a fixed point under f.
The converse of this result is trivially true.
Suppose f:œâ 1‚Üíœâ 1 is inflationary and continuous.
Then f‚Ä≤ is also inflationary and continuous.
It is worth contemplating the growth of the first few f Œ±.
The first fixed point past 0 is at x=œâ œâ.
This ordinal is of size that far, far surpasses any human powers of visualization.

This is clear if Œ±+1=Œ≤.
For all y‚ààœâ 1, we have y‚â§f y(1).
Suppose Œ±‚â§f Œ±(1) for all Œ±<Œ≤.
Therefore the function x‚Ü¶f x(1) is inflationary (by lemma ) and continuous.
Applying proposition , it has a least fixed point.
This fixed point is called the Feferman-Sch√ºtte ordinal, denoted by Œì 0.
Then in fact this last inequality is an equality.
However, Cantor normal form has the virtue of uniqueness.

Proof in the categorical semantics of homotopy type theory is below.
They are reviewed for instance as Lurie, prop. A.2.4.4.
The proof of the second statement is spelled out here.
A useful class of examples of this is implied by the following:
obtain the above prescription for how to construct homotopy pullbacks.
So let the ambient category be a suitable type-theoretic model category.
Of particular interest are consecutive homotopy pullbacks of point inclusions.
These give rise to fiber sequences and loop space objects.
See also the references at homotopy limit .
Homotopy pullbacks are at least mentioned in almost any textbook on homotopy theory.

A weakly √©tale morphism which is locally of finite presentation is an √©tale morphism.
Let R be a (possibly nonassociative and/or possibly nonunital) ring.
The real numbers are a Pythagorean ring.

Apart from this there are five exceptional Lie groups.
Let S‚äÇMor(C) be a class of morphisms.
Notice that the class of S-equivalences always contains S itself.
We say that S generates the strongly saturated class S¬Ø.
Of importance are the strongly saturated classes arising as follows.
For each object c‚ààC let j(c):C‚Üí‚àûGrpd op be the functor represented by c.
The following proposition characterizes the reflectors of a reflective (‚àû,1)-subcategory.
This appears as HTT, prop. 5.2.7.8.
Let p:K‚ÜíŒî[1] be the induced projection.
The following proposition asserts that localizations are entirely determined by the corresponding local objects.
Write S‚äÇMor(C) for the collection of morphisms that Loc sends to equivalences.
It follows that the bottom morphism is an equivalence.
This says that Locx is S-local, for all x‚ààC.
Hence f is indeed in S.
This is HTT, prop. 5.5.4.15.
It remains to prove the statements about the role of S in the localization:
Hence they in particular contain S.
So the second claim implies the first.
It remains to show that the third item implies the second.
Let f:c‚Üíd be a morphism such that Lf:Lc‚ÜíLd is an equivalence.
Consider the commuting triangle c ‚Üíf d ‚Üì ‚Üò ‚Üì Lc ‚ÜíLf Ld.
This is HTT, prop. 5.5.5.14. Proof
Regard all (‚àû,1)-categories as quasi-categories for the purpose of this proof.
Write D‚äÇFunc(Œî[1],C) for the full sub-quasicategory on the elements of S.
By the universality of the pushout, one finds that this is a coCartesian lift.
Hence D‚ÜíFunc({0},C)‚âÉC is a coCartesian fibration.
Moreover, one can check that D c has all small colimits.
Together this means that D c is a locally presentable (‚àû,1)-category.
Notice that g *t, being a pushout of t‚ààS, is itself in S.
This is (Lurie, lemma 5.5.4.17).
This is (Lurie, prop. A.3.7.8).
By the discussion at Bousfield localization of model categories this presents precisely such localizations.
This is HTT, prop. 6.2.1.1.
Since the terminal object is evidently S-local, we have L*‚âÉ*.
Applying L hence yields an equivalence L(x√óy)‚Üí‚âÉLx√óLy.
Of morphisms of this form we had seen above that they are in S.
So it remains to show that x√ó yz‚Üíx√ó Lyz is in S.
So now we need to show that the diagonal y‚Üíy√ó Lyy is in S.
Let C be a locally presentable (‚àû,1)-category with universal colimits.
Then S is strongly generated by a small set of morphisms.
This is HTT, Prop. 6.2.1.2.
Such f is obtained by choosing any coCartesian lift of a reflector p(f):p(c)‚Üíd¬Ø.
This means that also the top horizontal morphism is an equivalence.
This is discussed at rational homotopy theory in an (‚àû,1)-topos.

Let ùíú be a locally presentable category.
Such an endofunctor is well-pointed precisely when the monad is idempotent.
We have obvious categories of algebras of both sorts.
The converse holds in the well-pointed/idempotent case.
In fact, we have: Lemma
The putative transformation Œ∑:1‚ÜíT is the composition Œ±‚àòœÉ.
The last statement is almost obvious using Lemma above.
The basic theorem to which all others can be reduced is the following.
Therefore, the algebraically-free monad on S exists (and is accessible).
Applying the previous example on slice categories, we can construct orthogonal factorization systems.
Then T/ùíú is again locally presentable.
In particular, the algebraically-free monad on T exists and is accessible.
The monadicity theorem then applies.
Colimits can be constructed in T/ùíú and then reflected into TAlg.
A W-type in a category is an initial algebra for a polynomial functor.
Equivalently, it is the free algebra on the initial object for that functor.
Theorem The category TAlg is a reflective subcategory of T/ùíú.
Thus, by Lemma , L is well-pointed; now apply Theorem .
Corollary TAlg is locally presentable.
Moreover, any functor TAlg‚ÜíT‚Ä≤Alg induced by a monad morphism T‚Ä≤‚ÜíT has a left adjoint.
Since TAlg is reflective in the cocomplete T/ùíú, it is cocomplete.
Since it is accessible by the limit theorem, it is locally presentable.
We will show the category of V-algebras to be reflective in T/ùíú.
Thus, by Lemma , L is well-pointed; now apply Theorem .

In school mathematics, natural numbers with 0 are called whole numbers.
By default, our natural numbers always include 0.
The absolute value is defined as the distance of a natural number from zero.
This function f is said to be constructed by primitive recursion.

In classical mathematics, any inhabited subset of the natural numbers possesses a minimal element.

The moves were introduced in the book Reidemeister.
As usual in knot theory, everything is up to planar isotopy?.
Both isotopy and and regular isotopy define equivalence relations on link diagrams.
There are a number of variants of the R3 move.
The key idea of the proof is that of subdivision.

We can conclude that the Hopf link and the Borromean rings are not isotopic.

We are usually only interested in measurable almost functions.
Of course, a measure space also has plenty of structure for this.
That one only needs measurable functions to be defined almost everywhere is the same idea.

Specifically, cardinal numbers generalise the concept of ‚Äòthe number of ‚Ä¶‚Äô.
In particular, the number of natural numbers is the first infinite cardinal number.
One can construct this as a quotient set of that collection.
Lowercase Greek letters starting from Œ∫ are often used for cardinal numbers.

Contents C ‚àû-rings should not be confused with C ‚àû -algebras.
The standard name in the literature for generalized smooth algebras is C ‚àû-rings.
All constructions on smooth algebras generalize to (ùíØ,R)-algebras.
This is (Bunge-Dubuc, prop. 2.1).
There is a unique C ‚àû-ring structure on a Weil algebra W.
It makes W a finitely presented C ‚àû-ring.
Weil algebras play a crucial role in the definition of smooth toposes.
The claim follows from the observation that limits and directed colimits do commute with products.
See also MSIA, p. 22.
This makes A(‚Ñù) an ‚Ñù-algebra.
Every finitely presented C ‚àû-ring is fair/germ determined.
Let f:X‚ÜíZ and g:Y‚ÜíZ be transversal maps of smooth manifolds.
Rather one has an inclusion C ‚àû(X)(‚Ñù)‚äóC ‚àû(Y)(‚Ñù)‚äÇC ‚àû(X√óY)(‚Ñù).
In summary this yields the following characterization of smooth function algebras on manifolds.
From this structure alone a lot of further structure follows:
what it means concretely changes.
Here, however, compatibility with infinitely more operations f‚ààC ‚àû(‚Ñù n,‚Ñù) is demanded.

An arrow looks like an interval.
In a category we can glue arrows together, ‚Äòcomposing‚Äô them.
So, there should be a cocategory or something like that lurking around here.
Let us describe the H-cocategory structure on the interval cospan.
In other words, the cospan I carries an A ‚àû-cocategory structure.
Let us make this more explicit.
This category is precisely the fundamental groupoid Œ† 1(X).
It is pretty clear from this description that Œ† 1(X) is functorial in X.
The fundamental 0-groupoid Top‚Üí0Cat is the connected components functor Œ† 0:Top‚ÜíSet.
The category (n+1)Cat admits finite products and arbitrary sums over which products distribute.
(This theorem is needed to push the induction through.)

This entry contains one chapter of the material at geometry of physics.
Ever since Isaac Newton, theories of physics are formulated in the language of mathematics.
Modern physics is formulated in terms of modern mathematics in the most intimate way.
While fundamental, this theory has free parameters.
These index different flavors of the same general mechanism.
(This is the traditional formulation.
Most of this was fairly well understood decades ago, by the 1960s.
Hence we should think of this as formalizing topological local field theory.
The formalization of extended topological field theory thus captures the local aspect of field theory.
So we are after a picture as indicated in the following table.
Assume for simplicity that the site has enough points (which SmthMfd does).
The higher refinement of groupoids which we need are ‚àû-groupoids.

This is the extended Lagrangian for abelian Chern-Simons theory.
Now we consider further examples whose higher geometry has not necessarily been considered traditionally.

We discuss two equivalent ways of defining Day convolution
We observe now that Day convolution is equivalently a left Kan extension.
This will be key for understanding monoids and modules with respect to Day convolution.
Let ùíû be a small V-monoidal category.
This perspective is highlighted in (MMSS 00, p. 60).
The tensor product ‚äó:ùíû‚äóùíû‚Üíùíû induces a representable profunctor ùíû(‚äó,1):ùíû‚á∏ùíû‚äóùíû.
This is claimed without proof in (Day 70).
First note that the equivalence between the two formulas follows from the Yoneda lemma.
In functional programming, these monoids give rise to the notion of Applicative.
This is stated in some form in (Day 70, example 3.2.2).
It was highlighted again in (MMSS 00, prop. 22.1).
See also MO discussion here.
This is just the structure of a monoid object on F under ‚äó Day.
Then the Day convolution product is F‚ãÜG:e‚Ü¶‚äï c‚ãÖd=eF(c)√óG(d).
Precisely because by assumption C has only identity morphisms.
There is an obvious monoidal structure on the cube category.
By Day convolution this induces a monoidal structure on cubical sets.
This in turn induces a monoidal structure on strict omega-categories.

Roughly speaking, an ‚àû-cosmos is a simplicially enriched category of fibrations and fibrant objects.
Then the full subcategory of fibrant objects defines an ‚àû-cosmos.
For simplicity, we define only an ‚àû-cosmos with all objects cofibrant.
See the references below for the general definition.
We display equations for the horizontal filtering, the other case works analogously.
For the moment see at spectral sequence for a list.
The limiting case of this is the Taylor series.

There are also versions that generalize the mean value theorem:
Two singular chains are homologous if they differ by a boundary.
Write SingX‚àà sSet for its singular simplicial complex.
Remark These are the chains on a simplicial set on SingX.
See also at ordinary homology.
This is called the push-forward of œÉ along f.
From this the statement follows since ‚Ñ§[‚àí]:sSet‚ÜísAb is a functor.
In particular for each n‚àà‚Ñï singular homology extends to a functor H n(‚àí,R):Top‚ÜíRMod.
Let X be a topological space.
Let œÉ 2:Œî 2‚ÜíX be a singular 2-chain.
For more illustrations see for instance (Ghrist, (4.5)).
Its kernel is the commutator subgroup of œÄ 1(X,x).
This is known as the Hurewicz theorem.
For the present purpose one makes the following definition.
The dual notion is that of singular cohomology.
The analogous notion in algebraic geometry is given by Chow groups.
second-countable: there is a countable base of the topology.
metrisable: the topology is induced by a metric.
separable: there is a countable dense subset.
Lindel√∂f: every open cover has a countable sub-cover.
metacompact: every open cover has a point-finite open refinement.
first-countable: every point has a countable neighborhood base
second-countable spaces are Lindel√∂f.
weakly Lindel√∂f spaces with countably locally finite base are second countable.
separable metacompact spaces are Lindel√∂f.
Lindel√∂f spaces are trivially also weakly Lindel√∂f.
a first-countable space is obviously Fr√©chet-Urysohn.
a Fr√©chet-Uryson space is obviously sequential.
a sequential space is obviously countably tight.
paracompact spaces satisfying the countable chain condition are Lindel√∂f.
This holds for many examples, but not for all.
In particular, when considering continuous real-valued functions.
Thus we have the following connections to the separation axioms.
The resulting function is the required f n.
We need to prove that this is continuous.
Thus f is continuous everywhere except possibly at v.
As such it has in particular kernels and cokernels.

Moreover, this is natural in A‚ààùíú.
Thus we have the corresponding double complex G(I ‚Ä¢,‚Ä¢) in ùíû.
This establishes the spectral sequence and its second page as claimed.
It remains to determine its convergence.
This is treated at generalized the.
Formal treatments employ the uniqueness quantifier to specify unique existence.
We will give some examples below.
Everything below applies dually to 2-colimits, the higher analogues of colimits.
See strict 2-limit for details.
Therefore, we usually call these simply ‚Äúlimits.‚Äù
In the following examples we work in a 2-category K.
In Cat, comma objects are comma categories.
Of particular importance is the case when C is the walking arrow 2.
We may say (2,1)-limits and (2,1)-colimits in this case.
A (2,1)-category is a special case of an (‚àû,1)-category.
(2,1)-limits can often also be viewed in this way.
(The equivalence of homotopy limits with (‚àû,1)-limits is discussed at (‚àû,1)-limit).
Here Q l is the lax morphism classifier? for 2-functors.
Therefore, lax limits are really a special case of 2-limits.
Here are some examples.
Note that this is equivalent to a comma object (f/1 B).
Note that lax pullbacks are not the same as comma objects.
Thus, it is a representing object for lax natural transformations J‚ÜíK(F‚àí,L).
Here are some examples of lax and oplax colimits:
This yields a construction of certain pseudo 2-colimits in Cat.
Moreover, a similar result holds more generally when C is a bicategory.
But I don‚Äôt know whether everyone realizes that this is true.

This entry is about loops in topology.
All of these variations can be combined, of course.
(A Moore loop at a has f(kn)=a instead of f(k)=a.
In this context, a Moore loop is called a cycle.
Every loop may be interpreted as a path.
However, this is correct only in certain contexts.
In continuous spaces, it is also correct.

At best, we can only talk about isomorphisms of manifolds.
The setting is a topological space X together with a pseudogroup G on X.
Often it is also assumed that the topology has a countable basis as well.
In many of the typical cases, this will mean that M is metrizable.
This is encoded by the following definition of isomorphisms between manifolds.
Morphisms of manifolds are here called smooth maps, and isomorphisms are called diffeomorphisms.
Simply take the inclusions of open sets as charts.
But if Todd agrees with me, then maybe he'll add it.

I've read through it once, and it makes sense.
I'll read through it again more carefully later.
These local posets are not cocomplete, but they admit certain obvious joins
The object Ext(r) may be called the extension of r.
Let M be a (C,X)-manifold and N a (C,Y)-manifold.
The (2,1)-category of (2,1)-sheaves on a (2,1)-site is a Grothendieck-(2,1)-topos.
The term exact category has several different meanings.
This is distinct from the notion of Quillen exact category.
Exact categories are also called effective regular categories.
Therefore, congruences have quotients in an exact category.
The codomain fibration of an exact category is a stack for its regular topology.
Any topos is an exact category.
Any category which is monadic over a power of Set is exact.
A proof may be found here.
Any abelian category is exact.
In fact an abelian category is precisely an exact additive category.
See Theorem 5.11 of Barr‚Äôs Exact Categories.
Any slice or co-slice of an exact category is also exact.
If C is already exact, then C ex/reg is equivalent to C.
See regular and exact completions.

This is the statement of the K-theory classification of topological phases of matter.
In this paper, we develop a general systematic framework to understand these problems.
This is a sub-entry of scheme and derived scheme.
This entry discusses a higher-categorical perspective on that standard notion.
This lattice naturally forms a locale, or 0-topos.
See the examples at derived scheme for more details on this.
Linearly compact vector spaces were introduced in the development of the idea of duality.
A standard reference for the basics is the Dieudonn√©‚Äòs book on formal groups.
The next definition is copied from Tom Leinster‚Äôs note that‚Äôs listed below.
The topology is linear: the open affine subspaces form a basis for the topology.
Any family of closed affine subspaces with the finite intersection property has nonempty intersection.
The topology is Hausdorff.
Every pseudocompact module is linearly compact.
In components, the definition of submersion reads as follows.
More abstractly formulated, this means equivalently the following.
This is because a submersion is transversal to every other smooth map into its codomain.
Moreover, submersions are stable under pullback.
They appear notably in the definition of Lie groupoids.
Ehresmann's theorem states that a proper submersion is a locally trivial fibration.
See the discussion at SynthDiff‚àûGrpd for details.
The algebraic geometry analogue of a submersion is a smooth morphism.
There is also topological submersion, of which there are two versions.
Idea Focusing is an idea originating in the proof theory of linear logic.
This is the diagonal action.
The actual definition of cellular homology is below.
We define ‚Äúordinary‚Äù cellular homology with coefficients in the group ‚Ñ§ of integers.
The analogous definition for other coefficients is immediate.
This is discussed at Relative homology - Homology of CW-complexes.
This appears for instance as (Hatcher, theorem 2.35).
A proof is below as the proof of cor. .

The term ‚Äúnatural homomorphism‚Äù is introduced on p. 196.
Independently they were seen in topos theory (Bunge 90, Moerdijk 91).
Bibundles also appear as transition bundles of nonabelian bundle gerbes.
We often write H‚âî Smooth‚àûGrpd for short.
This is evidently more constrained than just morphisms ùí¢‚Üíùí¶ by themselves.
Hence all Morita morphisms, def. , to the pair groupoid are equivalent.
Obviously these actions are free.
When a free action has representible quotient, it must automatically be proper.
It is free and proper because the right action of H on E is so.
Moreover, those who free and proper is (are), remains so.
It is (2,1)-category because 2-morphisms are obviously invertible.
This (2,1)-category is equivalent to the one obtained by generalised morphism or by anafunctors.
The follwing is taken from the latter article.
The following constructions work by repeatedly applying the following identification:
The central definition here is now:
In particular one has the following identifications.

One can, therefore, argue that only strict deformation quantization is genuine quantization.
Gluing local solutions to the quantization problem furthermore involves stacks and specifically gerbes.
But this is really the case corresponding to perturbation theory in quantum field theory.
Every Poisson manifold has a (formal) deformation quantization.
This was shown in (Kontsevich 97).
There the deformed product is constructed by a kind of Feynman diagram perturbation series.
See there for more details.
Let X be a smooth algebraic variety over a field ùïú of characteristic 0.
This is a consequence of the following result.
Here is the result.
(See also Van den Bergh.)
It is independent of choices up to quasi-isomorphism.
Theorem 4 implies: Theorem (Yekutieli).
Assume that the cohomology groups H 1(X,ùí™ X) and H 2(X,ùí™ X) vanish.
It preserves first order brackets.
When X is affine this is Theorem 0.1 of this paper.
For the full statement see Corollary 11.2 of this paper.
See the paper and the survey.
(This is graded symmetric.)
This defines a graded Lie bracket of degree -1.
Note that Œº is associative iff Œº‚àòŒº=0 iff [Œº,Œº]=0.
Apply this example to the construction of deformation quantization.
It can be verified that this is an equivalence relation.
The Deligne conjecture gives a relationship between these things.

This has been shown in (Godin).
One of the BU(1)-summands is also produced in (Igusa02).
A detailed complete proof appears as (Kupers, theorem 3.59).
The pullback i *TY can be of course interpreted as the restriction TY| X.
The dual notion is that of conormal bundle.
The notion also makes sense for some other contexts, e.g. for smooth algebraic varieties.
Then one just uses the homotopy invariance of vector bundles.
This is due to (Boothby-Wang 58).
The following is taken from (Lin).

In all notions of generalized smooth spaces all pullbacks do exist.
But they may still not be the ‚Äúright‚Äù pullbacks.
For instance cohomology of pullback objects may not have the expected properties.
This is solved by passing to smooth derived stacks, such as derived smooth manifolds.
This construction has benefited tremendously from the adoption of the nPOV.
Using this point of view, the general strategy becomes naturally evident.

Hadamard states are mathematically characterized as follows:
This is usually called a Wightman propagator.
(Unfortunately the term ‚ÄúHadamard propagator‚Äù is used for something else.)
The resulting algebra of observables is the Wick algebra of the free scalar field.
These states are therefore called Hadamard states.
Recall the following general facts about the wave equation/Klein-Gordon equation
Let (X,g) be a globally hyperbolic spacetime.
Then a Hadamard distribution œâ according to def. does exist.
These integral kernels are the advanced/retarded ‚Äúpropagators‚Äù.
We discuss this by a variant of the Cauchy principal value:
This integration domain may then further be completed to two contour integrations.
The last line is the expression for the causal propagator from prop. .
Next we similarly parameterize the vector x‚àíy by its rapidity œÑ.
Here J 0 denotes the Bessel function of order 0.
The important point here is that this is a smooth function.
The last line is Œî H(x,y), by definition .
On the left this identifies the causal propagator by (9), prop. .
This does not change the integral, and hence H is symmetric.
In the first step we introduced the complex square root œâ ¬±œµ(k‚Üí).

This hom-object is hence a hom-groupoid in this case.
This is true when the source is compact.
Thus, in particular, this applies to loop spaces.
This raises the obvious question as to how general this result can be made.
The purpose of this page is to determine the answer.
Our conjecture is the following:
Let M be a smooth manifold that admits a local addition.
Then the Fr√∂licher space of smooth maps from N to M is a smooth manifold.
For a more recent version see (Stacey). Background and Remarks
In this line, the original category is viewed mainly as a source of ideas.
One can make an analogy with the real and complex numbers.
Let N be a sequentially compact Fr√∂licher space.
Let {P i:P i‚äÜM} be a family of submanifolds of M.
We assume that the pair (M,{P i}) admits a local addition.
We shall also assume, for simplicity, that the domain of Œ∑ is TM.
Let g:N‚ÜíM be a smooth map with g(Q i)‚äÜP i.
By applying the projection to the second factor, we obtain a map f^:N‚ÜíTM.
Composing with Œ∑ produces a map Œ∑‚àòf^:N‚ÜíM.
Let us identify its image.
Let V‚äÜM√óM be the image of the local addition.
Let us start with the image.
Together with the identity on N, we get a map N‚ÜíN√óTM.
Moreover, this construction yields the inverse of Œ¶ and so it is a bijection.
Thus we have charts for C ‚àû(N,M;Q,P).
The next step is the transition functions.
This will show that our resulting manifold structure is independent of this choice.
Let E 1=E g 1 and E 2=E g 2.
We define W 12‚ààg 1 *TM as follows.
We describe a point in g 1 *TM by specifying its point in N√óTM.
Similarly, we have a map œï 12 in the other direction.
Both of these maps are smooth since they are smooth into N√óTM.
Let us consider œï 12œï 21(x,v).
The transition function is f‚Ü¶œï 21‚àòf.
Let us start with the domain and codomain of the transition function.
The domain is {f‚ààE 1:Œ¶ 1(f)‚ààU 2}.
It is therefore completely characterised by the fact that Œ¶ 2Œ® 21=Œ¶ 1.
Hence Œ® 21(f)=œà 21‚àòf and thus Œ® 21 is a diffeomorphism.
We discuss that and how these two smooth structures coincide.
Proposition The functor Œπ:FrechetManifolds‚Ü™DiffeologicalSpaces is a full and faithful functor.
This appears as (Losik, theorem 3.1.1).
This appears as (Waldorf, lemma A.1.7).
The generalization to mapping stacks of differentiable stacks is discussed in
For the moment see at S-matrix this definition.
For the moment see at S-matrix this prop.
The ‚Äòinfinitesimal‚Äô symmetries are the derivations X:A‚ÜíA, with X(ab)=X(a)b+X(b)a.
This is the case discussed in the section Over ordinary rings below.
This is discussed in the section Over smooth rings regarded as ordinary rings.
Conversely, every module arises this way, up to isomorphism.
So this gives an equivalent way of defining modules over rings.
And this is the right definition.
Notably, this definition does not assume anything about the ring R.
It does not even assume that R is a ring at all!
Notice that this is now a definition.
And that R could be anything, and the definition still makes sense.
Suppose A is a commutative algebra over a field k.
We may define K√§hler differentials either by an explicit construction or by a universal property.
In fact there are two explicit constructions.
The simplest construction, maybe, is as follows.
In particular there are only finite sums in the module of K√§hler differentials.
Another more sophisticated construction of Œ© K 1(A) is given below.
We say that X factors through d.
The following special case deserves special attention:
We discuss how K√§hler differential forms relate to the ordinary notion of differential forms.
However, we have de t‚â†e tdt as K√§hler differentials.
To avoid this annoying property of K√§hler differentials we can proceed as follows.
Now, suppose A=C ‚àû(M) where M is any smooth manifold.
We can expand on this remark as follows.
Couldn‚Äôt resist the above uncredentialed drive-by edit‚Ä¶
Is it torsionlessness that ultimately discerns differential geometry from algebraic geometry?
All this is general abstract nonsense, nothing special to this example!
There‚Äôs a lot less here than meets the eye.
That actually makes a little sense to me.
There is a mistake in the explanation by John Baez here.
The first one is not, though.
This module is equipped with a universal A-derivation.
This object of differential forms satisfies a universal property with respect to derivations.
Contents Idea A module spectrum is a module over a ring spectrum.
This is (Lurie, cor. 1.5.15).
, write HR for the corresponding Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum.
This presents a corresponding equivalence of (‚àû,1)-categories.
This equivalence on the level of homotopy categories is due to (Robinson).
The refinement to a Quillen equivalence is (SchwedeShipley, theorem 5.1.6).
See also the discussion at stable model categories.
This is a stable version of the Dold-Kan correspondence.

Another example is the use of weak topologies on locally convex topological spaces.
Let ùíØ be an essentially small category.
Then the Isbell envelope of ùíØ, written E(ùíØ), is defined as follows.
(We conventionally write X=(P X,F X,c X).)
Certain elementary properties are easy to prove.
The Isbell envelope of a category can be viewed as a category of profunctors.
Let us spell this out.
Recall that a profunctor ùíú‚Üí‚Ñ¨ is a functor ùíú√ó‚Ñ¨ op‚ÜíSet.
The composition of these as profunctors produces the obvious profunctor ùîâ√óùîä:ùíú√ó‚Ñ¨ op‚ÜíSet.
There is an obvious profunctor ùíØ‚ÜíùíØ given by the Hom-bifunctor.
This is the identity for profunctor composition.
This characterization relates directly to a definition of Cauchy completion.
A variant of the above involves a background category, say ùí∞.
Translating this back to the language of functors yields the following definition.
An obvious condition is that the presheaf is actually a sheaf.
Another useful condition is that of Isbell duality.
Clearly, the last is the intersection of the first two.
Now we transfer this to the Isbell envelope of ùíØ.
Let X=(P,F,c) be an object of E(ùíØ).
Let us write |X| T for the set of constant elements in P(T).
Let T 0 be an object in ùíØ.
The assignment X‚Üí|X| T 0 is functorial and extends the assignment T‚Üí|T| T 0.
A ùíØ‚Äìmorphism T 0‚ÜíT 1 defines a natural transformation of functors.
Let (Œ±,Œ≤) be a morphism from the first to the second.
Let Œ≥‚ààP 1(U 0) be a constant element.
Let T be an object in ùíØ and œï‚ààF 2(T).
We need to show that œï‚àò(Œ±‚àòŒ≥) is a constant morphism.
That the morphisms correspond is obvious.
Let Œ≥‚ààP(T 1) be a constant element.
Hence Œ≥‚àòœà is a constant element in P(T 0).
Useful to have an example here, of course.
Let us fix a ùíØ‚Äìobject T 0.
We can refine the notion of concreteness slightly.
Let ùíØ be an essentially small category with a concrete separator, say T 0.
Changing the concrete separator does not alter concreteness.
Clearly the first and second statements imply the third.
Let us consider the first.
Let S be a concrete separator in ùíØ.
We shall write |‚àí| for |‚àí| S.
Let T be an object of ùíØ.
Thus there is some œï‚ààF X(T‚Ä≤) such that Œ± T‚Ä≤(œï)‚â†Œ≤ T‚Ä≤(œï)‚ààùíØ(T,T‚Ä≤).
Using composition notation, we rewrite this as œï‚àòŒ±‚àòŒ¥‚â†œï‚àòŒ≤‚àòŒ¥.
Since œï‚àòŒ±‚àòŒ¥‚â†œï‚àòŒ≤‚àòŒ¥, they must be different constant elements.
Thus the maps Œ±,Œ≤:|T|‚Üí|X| are different and so X is P‚Äìconcrete.
The second statement is very similar.
Let S be a concrete separator in ùíØ.
Let T be an object of ùíØ.
Thus there is some Œ±‚ààP X(T‚Ä≤) such that œï T‚Ä≤(Œ±)‚â†œà T‚Ä≤(Œ±)‚ààùíØ(T‚Ä≤,T).
Using the composition notation, we rewrite this as œï‚àòŒ±‚àòŒ¥‚â†œà‚àòŒ±‚àòŒ¥.
As Œ¥ is a constant morphism, Œ±‚àòŒ¥‚ààP X(S) is a constant element.
Hence X is F‚Äìconcrete.
For more see the references at Isbell duality.
A category with an action of C is sometimes called a C-actegory.
Explicitly this has been considered in (Rezk).

Elementary calculus Let X=Y=Z=‚Ñù the real line.
Then the tangent bundle TX is canonically identified with ‚Ñù√ó‚Ñù.

There is however also another meaning of a corepresentation for a Leibniz algebra.
Conversely, any flat connection determines a right C-coaction by œÅ M(m)=‚àá(m)+m‚äóg.
This amounts to a bijection between C-coactions and flat connections on M.
Or dually one can work with connection on modules over additive monads.
A quasi-connection is a connection if, in addition, ŒΩ‚àò‚àá=0.
As usually, we define a flat connection as a connection whose curvature vanishes.
In this setting one again has a bijection between flat connections and descent data.
There are similar functors for bimodules and in some other categories.

This means that it is an etale geometric morphism.
One checks that these constructions establish an equivalence (‚àû,1)Topos(H,‚àûGrpd /X)‚âÉH(*,LConstX).
The composite of these is the equivalence to be shown.

For other notions see monad (disambiguation).

A Lawvere theory is another special sort of monad in Cat.

Many of these monads also have standard usages as monads in computer science.
This is called the maybe monad in computer science.
This is a commonly used monad in computer science.
Replacing the two element power object Œ© with any other set gives similar monads.

Let M be a finite dimensional smooth manifold.
An extremely useful tool when studying a submanifold is a tubular neighbourhood.
The situation for coindicence submanifolds is considered in tubular neighbourhood of a mapping space.
Here we shall consider submanifolds defined by the circle action.
Let E‚ÜíB be a fibre bundle with typical fibre S.
The crucial ingredient in this is what we call a local averaging function.
Let us illustrate this with S={1,‚àí1}.
However, this will not work on M because the sum does not make sense.
Our solution is to put M inside ‚Ñù n.
In ‚Ñù n, we can form a 0‚âî12a 1+12a ‚àí1.
There is one more subtlety.
Thus their effects should be separable.
To make this concrete, we use the orthogonal structure on the ambient Euclidean space.
Then d pŒπ:T pM‚ÜíT Œπ(p)‚Ñù n embeds T pM in T Œπ(p)‚Ñù n.
Let us write this as N p.
Then N p is the fibre of the normal bundle of the embedding at p.
Let us identify M with its image.
Our first task is to construct a tubular neighbourhood.
Let us write Œº:X‚ÜíM for this composition.
This map Œº is the local averaging function that we need.
The other half is provided by a local addition.
There is an orthogonal projection map ‚Ñù n‚ÜíT pM, projecting along N p.
Restricting this to M, we obtain a map Œª p:M‚ÜíT pM.
Allowing p to vary, we obtain a smooth map Œª:M√óM‚ÜíTM.
Let us write X p for the corresponding open ball.
Let U p=U‚à©T pM.
Then Œ∑(U p) is a subset of {p}√óM.
Let Œ∑ p:U p‚ÜíV p‚äÜM be the obvious restriction.
The map Œº projects X on to M also by projecting along N p.
What we have so far can be portrayed in the following diagram.
Knowing this, we can compose Œ± with Œ∑ œÑŒ± ‚àí1 to produce a map S‚ÜíU.
Let us write this as Y.
This follows from the way that Œ∑ œÑŒ≤ and œÑ were constructed.
The second is by construction: Œ∑ œÑŒ≤ has image in U œÑŒ≤.
The construction is invariant under measure-preserving diffeomorphisms of S.

Proof Follows from the definition of 1-truss bundles.
The theorem now generalizes to labelled 1-truss bundles as follows.
Follows from the definition of ùîó 1(C).
Importantly, the construction of ùîó(C) is functorial in C.
This yields the labeled bordism functor ùîó 1:Cat‚ÜíCat
Most of the theory works the same across the spectrum.
Another important part of truss theory is normalization.
We describe how this works in two examples.
Bare (unlabeled) trusses are combinatorial analogues of meshes.
The relation is given by the following theorem.
See Dorn-Douglas 2021, Ch. 4 for details.
Certain labeled trusses are the ‚Äòcombinatorial‚Äô analogues of manifold diagrams.
We first define the class of labeled trusses we are interested in.
A 1-truss is called open if its endpoint have dimension 1.
(See Dorn-Douglas 2022, Sec. 2 for details.)
Dualization of n-trusses is an involution.
This is discussed in e.g. in Dorn-Douglas 2022.
But we can do better than this.

If R is a field then this is a vector bundle.
Note that a commutative pregroup is simply an ordered group.
These are useful as they avoid the equality a‚â§a‚ãÖa l‚ãÖa‚â§a‚áía=a‚ãÖa l‚ãÖa for all a‚ààP.
If we drop the two expansion axioms, we get a protogroup.
Symmetrically, if we drop the left adjoints we get a right pregroup.

Both algebras and coalgebras for endofunctors on C are special cases of algebras for bimodules.
Returning to the endofunctor case, the general statement is: Proposition
It is true when C is complete, however.
Entirely analogous facts are true for pointed algebras over pointed endofunctors.
The initial algebra of an endofunctor provides categorical semantics for inductive types.
Suppose C is a category with coproducts and F:C‚ÜíC is an endofunctor.
Hence an initial object of (d‚ÜìU) is an initial algebra of an endofunctor.

There is one warning to keep in mind here.
We say that A carries the operations and satisfies the axioms.
We say that f preserves the operations.
A sorted variety or many-sorted variety is a generalisation.
Another generalisation is a quasivariety.

Take such a question as, ‚ÄúWill the sun rise to-morrow?‚Äù
The answer given by Mill is that the inference depends upon the law of causation.
But if so, how are empirical generalisations to be justified?
Let us see what Mill says on this subject.
Let us take the second question first.
A similar conclusion can be proved by similar arguments concerning any other logical principle.
In their writings, logic is practically identical with metaphysics.
In broad outline, the way this came about is as follows.
This is the most important respect in which Hegel uncritically assumes the traditional logic.
Again, Socrates is particular, ‚Äúmortal‚Äù is universal.
But to say ‚Äúthe particular is the universal‚Äù is self-contradictory.
They both arrived at their logical results by an analysis of mathematics.
After the beginnings, it belongs rather to mathematics than to philosophy.
What is in common is the form of the proposition, not an actual constituent.
The form remains unchanged throughout this series, but all the constituents are altered.
It is something altogether more abstract and remote.
We may also have knowledge of the form without having knowledge of the constituents.
This is one reason for the great importance of logical form.
Here no particular things or properties are mentioned: the proposition is absolutely general.
Before considering inference, therefore, logic must consider those simpler forms which inference presupposes.
Such an attitude naturally does not tend to the best results.
Such, for example, is the relation ‚Äúbrother or sister.‚Äù
Such again is any kind of similarity, say similarity of colour.
Relations of this sort are called symmetrical.
All relations that are not symmetrical are called non-symmetrical.
All the relations that give rise to series are of this kind.
Thus before, after, greater, above are transitive.
All relations giving rise to series are transitive, but so are many others.
A relation is said to be non-transitive whenever it is not transitive.
All kinds of dissimilarity are non-transitive.
Thus ‚Äúfather‚Äù is intransitive.
To those whose logic is not malicious, such a wholesale condemnation appears impossible.
Relations which have two terms are only one kind of relations.
A relation may have three terms, or four, or any number.
Jealousy, for example, is a relation between three people.
Thus such relations are by no means recondite or rare.
The existing world consists of many things with many qualities and relations.
And the same applies to relations of four terms or five or any other number.
Given any fact, there is an assertion which expresses the fact.
A negative assertion may be said to be a denial.
Thus a proposition is the same as what may be significantly asserted or denied.
All other kinds are more complicated.
Thus atomic facts are what determine whether atomic propositions are to be asserted or denied.
Thus logic would then supply us with the whole of the apparatus required.
But in the first acquisition of knowledge concerning atomic facts, logic is useless.
Such propositions are important to logic, because all inference depends upon them.
The practical utility of inference rests upon this fact.
But all empirical evidence is of particular truths.
They believed that all our knowledge is derived from the senses and dependent upon them.
Such general knowledge is to be found in logic.
This proposition is absolutely general: it applies to all things and all properties.
And it is quite self-evident.
Logic, we may say, consists of two parts.
But in this case it was only necessary to admit relations of two terms.
The case of judgment demands the admission of more complicated forms.
From poverty in the logical inventory, this view has often been held.
But it leads to absolutely insoluble difficulties in the case of error.
Suppose I believe that Charles I. died in his bed.
The old logic put thought in fetters, while the new logic gives it wings.

This implies that the arrow h is necessarily a coequalizer of Uf and Ug.

Thus, by Duskin‚Äôs monadicity theorem (Thm. ), U is monadic.
This latter fact can, however, be proven using the monadicity theorem.
The monadicity theorem also plays a central role in monadic descent.
This induces furthermore a notion of homotopy fibers, hence of homotopy equivalences between types.
The name univalence (due to Voevodsky) comes from the following reasoning.
In the language of (‚àû,1)-category theory, a univalent bundle is an object classifier.
The univalence axiom does not literally say that anything is univalent in this sense.
Let us assume an arbitrary notion of equivalence type ‚âÉ 0.
Now, let us assume an arbitrary notion of equivalence type ‚âÉ.
See fundamental theorem of identity types for proofs that these definitions are the same.
In addition, the internal and external versions of univalence imply each other.
The fibration E‚ÜíB is univalent in ùíû if this morphism is a weak equivalence.
The fibration E‚ÜíB is univalent, precisely when this morphism is a weak equivalence.
This appears originally as Voevodsky, def. 3.4
See (Shulman 12, UF 13) (‚Ä¶)
The univalence axiom implies function extensionality.
In this section we assume that the universe is a Tarski universe.
Canonicity has been proved for cubical type theory.
propositional extensionality contrary to univalence is the axiom UIP directed univalence axiom
Earlier documentation of the univalence axiom in modern form is hard to come by:
This discusses canonicity of univalence in its section 13.
(But it works with Tarski universes, see there and type universes).

Heraclitus was an ancient philosopher.
The primary source on Heraclitus is Diogenes La√´rtius (~200AD).
The origin of philosophy is to be dated from Heraclitus.
Heraclitus was thus universally esteemed a deep philosopher and even was decried as such.
It was for the same reason that in the Athenian Democracy great men were banished.

Schleiermacher also collected them and arranged them in a characteristic way.
Seventy-three passages are given.
Hippocrates, likewise, is a philosopher of Heraclitus‚Äô school.
But we have another sentence that gives the meaning of the principle better.
But this does not contradict Heraclitus, who means the same thing.
The question arises as to how this diversity is to be comprehended.
This is quite applicable to the primary principle of Heraclitus.
This is general and very obscure.
We thus have, on the whole, a metamorphosis of fire.

We call this the left invariant G-structure.
Consider any group homomorphism G‚ÜíGL(V).
Indeed, this is a phenomenon known as the torsion constraints in supergravity.
Remarkably, any such thing is an abelian algebraic group.
The assumption of connectedness is necessary for that conclusion.
Say a point of Y is a morphism p:1‚ÜíY.
Suppose f:G‚ÜíH is any morphism in C preserving the identity.
Then f is a homomorphism.
Furthermore k(g,1)=1 for all g‚ààG so k(g,g‚Ä≤) is independent of g.
This says that f(g‚ãÖg‚Ä≤)=f(g)‚ãÖf(g‚Ä≤), so f preserves multiplication.
This in turn implies that f preserves inverses, so f is a group homomorphism.
Thus, r is constant at the identity of H, and hence so is k.
This in turn implies that G is abelian.
Then the forgetful functor U:AbVar‚ÜíVar * is full.
This follows immediately from the two theorems above.

As special cases, we have that Euclidean geometry is decidable.
Differential calculus over the real numbers is decidable.
In brief, semialgebraic relations form a cartesian bicategory of relations.

Notice that hence the composition law does not change when passing to the opposite category.
Only the interpretation of in which direction the arrows point does change.
So forming the opposite category is a completely formal process.
In the literature, F op is often confused with F.
Again, in the literature t op is often confused with t.
Note that the braiding of V is used in defining composition for C op.
If V is symmetric these two definitions coincide.

There is also a dual version, quantum heap.
This term also appears in English as ‚Äògroud‚Äô.
A heap homomorphism, of course, is a function that preserves the ternary operations.
This defines a category Heap of heaps.
This construction defines a functor Prin:Grp‚ÜíHeap.
There are a number of ways to define Aut(H) from H.
(We think of (a,b) as representing a ‚àí1b.)
The following theorem shows that the two equivalence relations are the same.
Similarly (ii) follows from (iii).
In particular, the categories Heap and Grp are not equivalent.
Therefore, H is an Aut(H)-torsor (over a point).
Then the empty set becomes a heap in a unique way.
For this reason, one usually requires a heap to be inhabited.

Here we briefly survey the relevant definitions and facts of Fourier analysis.
We use the following terminology:
This is also called the Schwartz space.
(compactly supported smooth function are functions with rapidly decreasing partial derivatives)
This is a dense subspace inclusion.
It is in this sense that tempered distributions are ‚Äúgeneralized functions‚Äù.
(square integrable functions induce tempered distributions)
this follows immediately from the Fourier inversion theorem for smooth functions (prop. ).
(prop. does not apply here!).
This we further discuss in Microlocal analysis and UV-Divergences below.
Conversely, smooth functions are the non-singular distributions (prop. ).
This means that these directions are the ‚Äúwave front‚Äù of the distributional solution.
This is called H√∂rmander's criterion (prop. below).
We now say this in detail:
This is called the wave front set (def. ) below.
Otherwise k is non-regular.
wave front set is the UV divergence-direction-bundle over the singular support)
Its wave front set (def. ) is WF(H)={(0,k)|k‚â†0}.
Let P be a differential operator (def. ).
Therefore we now collect some basic definitions and facts on Cauchy principal values.

This integration domain may then further be completed to two contour integrations.
Wightman propagator on Minkowski spacetime is distributional solution to Klein-Gordon equation)
The last line is Œî H(x,y), by definition .
On the left this identifies the causal propagator by (20), prop. .
This does not change the integral, and hence H is symmetric.
Similarly the anti-Feynman propagator is Œî F¬Ø‚âîi2(Œî ++Œî ‚àí)‚àíH.
where in the second line we used Euler's formula.
In the first step we introduced the complex square root œâ ¬±œµ(k‚Üí).

Define a homotopy H:[0,1]√ó(V‚àñ{0})‚ÜíV‚àñ{0} by H t(v)=(1‚àít)v+tTv.
Then we define a homotopy G:[0,1]√ó(V‚àñ{0})‚ÜíV‚àñ{0} by G t(v)=(1‚àít)Tv+tv 0.
Combining these two homotopies results in the desired contraction of V‚àñ{0}.

Not to be confused with Arthur Harold Stone, a general topologist.

Let us consider first the case of topological spaces.
Let O(X) denote the topology of X.
This is a left exact comonad on P(X).
The necessity is clear since W‚Ä≤‚äÜK.
The sufficiency is equivalent to having an inclusion W‚Ä≤‚à©int X(W‚à™K)‚Ü™‚àí‚àíint X(W‚à™W‚Ä≤).
This is well-known.
We can turn all this around.
The development given above generalizes readily to the context of locales.
Thus, let X be a locale, with corresponding frame denoted by O(X).
(NB: for topological spaces, this is U‚áíV=int X(V‚à™¬¨U).
The coalgebra category forms a frame.
Objects of Gl(Œ¶) are triples (e,e‚Ä≤,f:e‚Ä≤‚ÜíŒ¶(e)).

More fundamentally the field of gravity is instead a vielbein field.

This is then discussed in full detail in the Definition-section below.
These are important in the full quantum theory.
A formulation accurate and encompassing enough to see this issue is AQFT on curved spacetimes.
The authors then try to circumvent this by restricting to trivial instanton sectors.
But notice that instanton sectors is a non-negligible phenomenon.
All this is fixed by the formulation that we discuss below.
But there are more advantages, slightly less obvious.
These we come to in the following points.
For the present discussion assume that this is given.
Assume then such orientation field o X is given.
This is sometimes called the Spin-lifting bundle gerbe of o X.
A choice of Spin structure is a choice of section of this 2-bundle.
Again, this is faithfully captured only in higher geometry.
It serves as ‚Äúbackground‚Äù over which spin structure fields can be considered.
(Discussed in detail in Ordinary gravity below.)
Hence also gravity becomes a sigma-model-type field theory in higher geometry.
But this is not considered in isolation.
These problems are fixed by passing to higher geometry.

Several examples of this are discussed below.
we may call the moduli ‚àû-stack of fields.
Here we discuss various properties of this object.
We briefly recall the central aspects of principal ‚àû-bundles in the (‚àû,1)-topos H.
Such groupal A ‚àû-algebra objects are group objects in H: ‚àû-groups.
In fact every ‚àû-group is of this form.
inverse B we call the delooping operation.
This leads to the following equivalent description.
This we discuss below in Relation to relative cohomology.

Every such is a field configuration of ordinary gravity on X.
(But see example below.)
More examples of this kind we discuss below in Type II Gravity and generalized geometry.
The next example is the differential refinement of the previous one.
This is because the theory of gravity is supposed to by generally covariant.
This induces also an ‚àû-action also on the tangent bundle.
Moreover the trivial bundle Fields‚âî(Diff(X)√óOrthStruc‚ÜíBDiff(X))‚ààH /BDiff(X) corresponds to the trivial action.
Evidently there is then also a notion of higher spin structure-fields.

The best one can hope for is a class-accessible category.
Let ùíû be an accessible category that is not essentially small.
Consider the category ùíú of all accessible functors ùíû‚ÜíSet.
In particular, ùíú is accessible if and only if ùíú locally presentable.
We claim ùíú is not accessible.
So consider ùíû(X,‚àí) for some object X that is not Œ∫-presentable.
(Such an X exists because ùíû is not essentially small.)
That said, ùíú is a class-locally presentable category.

The most lighweight model for spectra are sequential spectra.
The following def. is the traditional component-wise definition of sequential spectra.
Write SeqSpec(Top cg) for this category of topological sequential spectra.
For details on this see Part S ‚Äì Thom spectra.
This gives the structure maps for a homomorphism fÀú:X‚ü∂Maps(K,Y) *.
Running this argument backwards shows that the map f‚Ü¶fÀú given thereby is a bijection.
But having both on the right or both on the left does not work.
The colimit starts at k={0 ifq‚â•0 |q| ifq<0
This canonically extends to a functor œÄ ‚Ä¢:SeqSpec(Top cg)‚ü∂Ab ‚Ñ§.
The two component morphisms given in def. indeed agree.
Then consider the identity element in the top left hom-set.
By the commutativity of the diagram, these two images agree.
Hence [S 1,œÉÀú n] * is an isomorphism (prop.).
From this, all statements follow by inspection at finite stages.
The fourth statement follows with similar reasoning.
This means that we actually have a bijection between classes of objects.
But it is also immediate to directly check the universal property.
For such there are two other models for suspension and looping of spectra.
However, this map is non-trivial.
It represents ‚àí1 in [S 2,S 2] *=œÄ 2(S 2)=‚Ñ§.

The second statement is a special case of prop. .
The other cases follow analogously.)
From this the statement Œ© ‚àû‚àòŒ©‚âÉŒ©‚àòŒ© ‚àû follows by uniqueness of adjoints.
So let X‚ààTop cg */.
The point where this does become relevant is the content of remark below.)
This is called the ‚Äústrict model structure‚Äù for sequential spectra.
Accordingly, this carries the projective model structure on functors (thm.).
This immediately gives the statement for the fibrations and the weak equivalences.
It only remains to check that the cofibrations are as claimed.
Since components are parameterized over ‚Ñï, this condition has solutions by induction:
First of all there must be an ordinary lifting in degree 0.
It is clear that Œ© ‚àû preserves fibrations and acyclic cofibrations.
This is sufficient to deduce a Quillen adjunction.
Hence Œ£ ‚àû sends classical cofibrations of spaces to strict cofibrations of sequential spectra.
This shows that Œ£ ‚àû is a left Quillen functor.
Therefore we first consider now cofibrancy conditions already in the strict model structure.
This is a shift of a trunction of the sphere spectrum.
Hence the claim follows.
With this, inspection shows that also the above morphism is a relative cell complex.
We now turn to discussion of CW-approximation of sequential spectra.
First recall the relative version of CW-approximation for topological spaces.
Let f:A‚ü∂X be a continuous function between topological spaces.
By possibly including further into higher stages, we may choose i>n.
Hence we have obtained the next stage X^ n+1 of the CW-approximation.
There we will give a fully general account of the principles underlying the following.
Here we just consider a pragmatic minimum that allows us to proceed.
This is often referred to simply as a ‚Äútopological model category‚Äù.
Such a situation is called a Bousfield localization of a model category.
Hence one also speaks of reflective localizations.
Write ùíû Q for ùíû equipped with these classes of morphisms.
Let f be a fibration and a weak equivalence.
Consider its factorization into a cofibration followed by an acyclic fibration f:X‚ü∂‚ààCofiZ‚ü∂‚ààW‚à©FibpY.
We claim that (œÄ,f) here is a weak equivalence.
Let ùíû be a right proper model category.
Let Q:ùíû‚ü∂ùíû be a Quillen idempotent monad on ùíû, according to def. .
The condition Fib Q=RLP(W Q‚à©Cof Q) holds by definition of Fib Q.
First we consider the case of morphisms of the form f:Q(Y)‚ÜíQ(Y).
These may be factored with respect to ùíû as f:Q(X)‚ü∂‚ààW‚à©Cof‚ààiZ‚ü∂‚ààFibpQ(Y).
This is provided by the next statement.
We need to show that then f is a Q-fibration.
Hence it factors as iÀú:X‚ü∂‚ààW‚à©CofjX^‚ü∂‚ààW‚à©Fib=W Q‚à©Fib QœÄY√óQ(Y)Z.
Assume that f is a Q-fibration.
From this, lemma gives that p is a Q-fibration.
This combined field is also called the axio-dilaton.
Hence we use the concepts of homotopy equivalence instead of weak homotopy equivalence.
Throughout, write I‚âî[0,1]‚äÇ‚Ñù for the closed interval equipped with its Euclidean metric topology.

Let X be a topological space and A‚äÇX a non-empty subset.
Consider the equivalence relation on X which identifies all points in A with each other.
The resulting quotient space is denoted X/A.
Clearly the underlying diagram of underlying sets is a pushout in Set.
Conversely, assume that A‚à©S‚äÇA and B‚à©S‚äÇB are open.
We need to show that then S‚äÇX is open.
Consider now first the case that A;B‚äÇX are both open open.
Now consider the case that A,B‚äÇX are both closed subsets.
This exhibits S as the intersection of two open subsets, hence as open.
Then: The total rectangle is a pushout precisely if the right square is.
Let X be a topological space.
Let X be a topological space.
Then the canonical inclusions X‚ü∂Cyl(X)AAAA*‚ü∂Cone(X) are homotopy equivalences.
Hence every cone is a [contractible topological space]] (example ).
Let f:X‚ÜíY be a continuous function between topological spaces.
This is called the suspension of X.
But by lemma there is also a homeomorphism Cone(f)/Cone(X)‚âÉY/f(X).
Hence the statement follows by the universal property of the pushout.
Let f:X‚ÜíY be a continuous function with closed image f(X)‚äÇY.

The action functional is S(0,œï)=12‚à´ M‚Äñdœï‚Äñ h 2+‚ãÜm 2œï 2.
The action functional is S(œâ,œï)=12‚à´ M‚ÄñD œâœï‚Äñ 2+‚ãÜm 2‚Äñœï‚Äñ 2.
We recall some facts about Clifford algebras and the spin group.
We have dimC(p,q)=2 p+q.
This gives a central extension 1‚ÜíZ 2‚ÜíSpin(p,q)‚ÜíSO(p,q)‚Üí1.
We denote by C(p,q):=C(p,q)‚äó RC the complexification of the Clifford algebra.
The representation Œ£ is isometric with respect to H.
We also need some facts about spin structures.
Finally, we recall the definition of the Dirac operator.
It is defined as follows.
We write s=(X,v) with X‚ààSM and v‚ààV.
We consider the orthonormal frame Œ± X:=Œª(X):TM‚ÜíR n.
The action functional is S(œà):=‚à´ MDœà‚àß h‚ãÜœà+‚ãÜf‚àòœà.
We assume spacetime to have even dimension.
Further f=0 (they are massless).
In the standard model, neutrinos are left-handed Weyl spinors.
Dirac spinors have V=Œ£ +‚äïŒ£ ‚àí, so that dim C(V)=4.
The function f is taken to be f(v)=‚àímh(v,v).
In the standard model, electrons are Dirac spinors.
One starts with the following representation Œ≥:C(1,3)‚ÜíGl(4,C).
It satisfies Œ≥(v)‚ãÖŒ≥(v)=‚àí‚ü®v,v‚ü©I 4.
It splits into a direct sum of two representations equivalent to Œ£ + and Œ£ ‚àí.
The Dirac operator is now Dœà=Œ≥ i‚àÇ iœà, where Œ≥ i:=Œ∑ ikŒ≥ k.
Now, the Dirac equation is Œ≥ i‚àÇ iœà+imœà=0.
Let‚Äôs go back to Dirac‚Äôs orginial motivation
The smallest matrices satisfying this relation are the above ‚Äúgamma matrices‚Äù.
So, Dirac‚Äôs motivation actually fails for ‚Äúcurved spacetimes‚Äù.
Consider principal G k-bundles P k over M, for k=1,2.
Its action functional is S(œâ,œà):=‚à´ MD œâœà‚àß h‚ãÜœà+‚ãÜf‚àòœà.
Obviously œÅ SM and œÅ P commute.
The Euler-Lagrange equation is D œâœà+imœà=0.
If M=R 1,3 one can take SM=M√óSL(2,C).
This gives the ‚ÄúDirac equation‚Äù one usually finds in a textbook.

This set the tone for analytic philosophy‚Äôs opinion of Hegel for several decades.
But since then there has been much progress in the foundations of maths.
However, a suplattice homomorphism preserves joins, but not necessarily meets.
(Frame homomorphisms preserve all joins and finitary meets.)
It therefore is a complete and cocomplete Barr-exact category.
Thus the objects of Rel may be thought of as the free suplattices.
Of course, if C is itself small, then every presheaf is small.
We write PC for the category of small presheaves on C.
Moreover PC is locally small, and there is a Yoneda embedding C‚Ü™PC.
Since small colimits of small colimits are small colimits, PC is cocomplete.
If C is either complete or small, then PC is complete.

The Hellinger-Toeplitz theorem is a no-go theorem for quantum mechanics.
This means that the problems that accompany only densely defined operators cannot be avoided.
Definition: An operator is closed if its graph is closed
The smallest such extension is called the closure of T and is denoted by T¬Ø.
How can the closure not be the graph of an operator?
We let T * be the adjoint of an operator T.
It is selfadjoint if it is symmetric and D T=D T *.
A symmetric operator is essentially selfadjoint if its closure is selfadjoint.
Heisenberg replied: ‚ÄúWhat is the difference?‚Äù
One example is the spectral theorem.
The definition of the resolvent does not pose any problems compared to the bounded case:
The inverse operator is called the resolvent R Œª(T) of T at Œª.
Resolvents at different points commute and we have R Œª(T)‚àíR Œº(T)=(Œº‚àíŒª)R Œº(T)R Œª(T)
The proof can be done as in the bounded case.
If every U is an unitary operator, it is an unitary semigroup.

Here we define the ‚Äúraw syntax‚Äù for our type theory.
We will use ‚Äúnamed variables‚Äù.
Constructivists should assume that Var has decidable equality.
That is, we assume that fr(x,V)‚àâV.
We also assume for simplicity that if already x‚àâV then fr(x,V)=x.
We will also frequently use meta-variables.
For us the set of sorts is Sort={tm,ty}.
Our raw syntax, though untyped, will be strongly scoped.
Then we have an element C(X;M‚Üí)‚ààRaw(V,s).
If M=x‚ààV, we define x[œÉ]=œÉ(x).
That is, the structural rules respect Œ±-equivalence.
If A is a field one accordingly speaks of a differential field.

This is a sub-section of the entry cohesive (‚àû,1)-topos .
See there for background and context
We list fundamental structures and constructions that exist in every cohesive (‚àû,1)-topos.
Compare with the section Quasitoposes of concrete objects at cohesive topos.
(See the general discussion at local (‚àû,1)-topos.)
See also concrete (‚àû,1)-sheaf.
For more details on the following see also looping and delooping.
This object Œ© xX is canonically equipped with the structure of an ‚àû-group obect.
This follows from the above proposition which says that H necessarily has homotopy dimension ‚â§0.
We write B:Grpd(H)‚ÜíPointedConnected(H) for the inverse to Œ©.
For G‚ààGrp(H) we call BG‚ààPointedConnected(H)‚Ü™H the delooping of G.
The delooping object BG‚ààH is concrete precisely if G is.
We may therefore unambiguously speak of concrete cohesive ‚àû-groups.
Suppose that also Y is pointed and f is a morphism of pointed objects.
Then the ‚àû-fiber of an ‚àû-fiber is the loop space object of the base.
This follows from the pasting law for (‚àû,1)-pullbacks in any (‚àû,1)-category.
(see simplicial group for the notation).
a morphism c:A‚ÜíB represents the characteristic class [c]:H(‚àí,A)‚ÜíH(‚àí,B).
(See Hochschild cohomology for details.)
For us it defines this G-action.
This principality condition asserts that the groupoid object P//G is effective.
By Giraud's axioms characterizing (‚àû,1)-toposes, every groupoid object in H is effective.
We proceed by induction through on the height of this diagram.
Of special interest are principal ‚àû-bundles of the form P‚ÜíBG: Definition
This exhibits P^ as an A-principal ‚àû-bundle over P.
For the moment see the discussion at ‚àû-gerbe .
A slight variant of cohomology is often relevant: twisted cohomology.
Let C be pointed and write A‚ÜíB for its homotopy fiber.
By definition of A as the homotopy fiber of c, its pullback is A.
The following asserts that this is equivalent to the above definition.
By the pasting law for (‚àû,1)-pullbacks so is then the total outer diagram.
This justifies the following terminology.
The material to go here is at Schreiber, section 2.3.7.
ForX,Y‚ààH, write Y X‚ààH for the corresponding internal hom.
These are concordances of ‚àû-bundles.
See remark 2.22 in (SimpsonTeleman).
This is (dcct, 3.9.1).
See also at A1-homotopy theory continuum Galois theory
We discuss a canonical internal notion of Galois theory in H.
We call this the ‚àû-groupoid of locally constant ‚àû-stacks on X.
The first statement is just the adjunction (Œ†‚ä£Disc).
In the Examples we discuss the cohesive (‚àû,1)-topos H=(‚àû,1)Sh(TopBall) of topological ‚àû-groupoids
For that case we recover the ordinary higher van Kampen theorem:
We call X (n+1) the (n+1)-fold universal covering space of X.
The bottom morphism is the constant path inclusion, the (Œ†‚ä£Disc)-unit.
We will obtain a formal notion of non-flat parallel transport below.
We call ‚ô≠A the coefficient object for flat A-connections.
By the pasting law for (‚àû,1)-pullbacks the outer diagram is still a pullback.
This follows by the same kind of argument as above.
So if the left morphism is surjective on œÄ 0 then œÄ 0(Q)=*.
This is precisely the condition that pieces have points in H.
More details on this are at circle n-bundle with connection.
That extra structure is that of infinitesimal cohesion.
See there for more details.
Observation If H is cohesive, then expLie is a left adjoint.
Accordingly then Lie is part of an adjunction (expLie‚ä£Œì dR‚ô≠ dR).
For all X the object Œ† dR(X) is geometrically contractible.
We have for every BG that expLieBG is geometrically contractible.
We shall write Bexp(ùî§) for expLieBG, when the context is clear.
In particular we have the following.
If H is cohesive then we have expLie‚àòexpLie‚âÉexpLie‚àòŒ£‚àòŒ©.
From this we deduce that ‚ô≠ dR‚àò‚ô≠ dR‚âÉ‚ô≠ dR‚àòŒ©.
For G an ‚àû-group, there are canonical G-‚àû-actions on G and on ‚ô≠ dRBG.
Fix a 0-truncated abelian group object A‚ààœÑ ‚â§0H‚Ü™H.
For all n‚ààN we have then the Eilenberg-MacLane object B nA.
This is a general statement about the definition of twisted cohomology.
The square on the right is a pullback by the above definition.
We say that this is the differential coefficient object of B nA.
The bottom square is an ‚àû-pullback?
Let also the top square be an ‚àû-pullback.
These are stable under ‚àû-pullback, which proves the claim.
For more on this see at differential cohomology diagram.
Let A be the chosen abelian ‚àû-group as above.
Let dim(Œ£) be the maximum n for which this is true.
Let now again A be fixed as above.

This generalizes the notion of higher holonomy discussed above.
] denotes the cartesian internal hom; œÑ n‚àík denotes truncation in degree n‚àík;
conk n‚àík denotes concretification in degree (n‚àík).
In suitable situations this construction refines to an internal construction.

Examples of weight systems which are not Lie algebra weight systems are rare.
Fundamental weight systems are quantum states (arXiv:2105.02871)
This text originates in a talk at the Eighth Scottish Category Theory Seminar.
Whether true or not, one of the three was David Hilbert.
Here Hilbert's 6th problem asks mathematicians generally to find axioms for theories in physics.

The category SmthMfd of smooth manifolds is too small to accomplish this.
Objects in here include smooth manifolds, also diffeological spaces and general smooth spaces.
This also contains infinitesimal objects and indeed interprets the axioms of synthetic differential geometry.
But actually in modern physics one needs a bit more than this.
A fundamental example of this is Einstein‚Äòs notion of general covariance.
This apparent paradox is resolved in higher topos theory.
This is the formalization of ‚Äúgeneral covariance‚Äù for regions inside spacetime.
The other thing now is general covariance for fields on spacetime.
It turns out that the formalism automatically handles these now:
This is precisely the group of gauge equivalences on fields in general relativity.
Or X may be the phase space of the system.
Accordingly the mapping space [‚Ñù,X]‚ààH is the smooth path space of X.
This is the space of potential trajectories of the physical system.
This means that time evolution is then an action of ‚Ñù on X.
In fact this is still not quite the accurate statement.
Rather a phase space is a ‚Äúprequantization‚Äù of such data.
Now suppose œâ is actually a symplectic form.
This statement subsumes the core ingredients of classical mechanics.
See at prequantized Lagrangian correspondence for details.
More precisely, this applies to laws of motion in mechanics.
This terminology in physics apparently originates with Richard Tolman in 1917.
See at motivic quantization for how this appears in physics.
So these are phenomena which are intrinsically phenomena in geometric homotopy theory/(infinity,1)-topos theory.
Now a miracle happens.
But there it has more dramatic consequences.

The fundamental concept of homotopy theory is that of homotopy.
By composition this extends to a functor œÄ 0:Top‚ü∂Set.
In particular a deformation retraction, def. , is a weak homotopy equivalence.
Every such path may be though of as a left homotopy between its endpoints.
This is the compact-open topology:
Accordingly this is called the compact-open topology on the set of functions.
The construction extends to a functor (‚àí) (‚àí):Top lcH op√óTop‚ü∂Top.
Remark Proposition fails if Y is not locally compact and Hausdorff.
Therefore the plain category Top of all topological spaces is not a Cartesian closed category.
This going to be called the set of standard topological generating cofibrations.
A topological space is a cell complex if ‚àÖ‚ü∂X is a relative cell complex.
These are called Hurewicz fibrations.
But for simple special cases this is readily seen directly, too.

Assume that [Œ±] is in the kernel of f *.
This section recalls some standard arguments in model category theory.
Let ùíû be any category.
This gets already close to producing the intended factorization:
For the present purpose we just need the following simple version:
So let Y be a topological cell complex and C‚Ü™Y a compact subspace.
It is now sufficient to show that P has no accumulation point.
To that end, let c‚ààC be any point.
If c is a 0-cell in Y, write U c‚âî{c}.
Let Œ≥ be the ordinal of the full cell complex.
Hence it is now sufficient to show that Œ≤ max=Œ≥.
We argue this by showing that assuming Œ≤ max<Œ≥ leads to a contradiction.
So assume Œ≤ max<Œ≥.
Let X‚ü∂X^ be a J Top-relative cell complex.
Hence the composite œÄ n(X)‚ü∂‚âÉœÄ n(X^) is an isomorphism.
Hence œÄ n(X^)‚ÜíœÄ n(X) has trivial kernel and so is injective.
B) I Top-injective morphisms are in particular Serre fibrations
By definition this makes X^‚ÜíY a Serre fibration, hence a fibration.
Hence X‚ÜíX^ is a cofibration.
By lemma it is also a weak equivalence.
Right properness is immediate from the fact that all objects are fibrant.
Left properness needs an argument.
First check that weak equivalences are preserved under pushout of inclusion maps along cell attachments.
Then use that a general cofibration is a retract a relative cell complex inclusion.
Hence reduce to pushout along relative cell complexes.
Let ùíû be a category with terminal object and finite colimits.
It is immediate to check the relevant universal property.
For details see at slice category ‚Äì limits and colimits.
This is called the wedge sum operation on pointed objects.
In particular this may happen for ùíû= Top.
In other words: Top is not cartesian closed.
geometric realization of simplicial sets preserves products.
Such a full subcategory exists, the category of compactly generated topological spaces.
This we briefly describe now.
Let X be a topological space.
A subset A‚äÇX is called k-closed
Let X‚ààTop cg‚Ü™Top (def. ) and let Y‚ààTop.
This means that f ‚àí1(A) is k-closed in X.
In particular k is idemotent in that there are natural homeomorphisms k(k(X))‚âÉk(X).
Hence colimits in Top cg exists and are computed as in Top.
Recall that by corollary , all colimits of compactly generated spaces are again compactly generated.
Hence the result follows with prop. .
This shows the first case.
As discussed there, these latter terms are ambiguous.
We write [ùíû,ùíü] for the resulting category of topologically enriched functors.
The following records a slightly simplified version which is all that is needed here:
Recall also the Top-tensored functors F‚ãÖX from that example.

This entry discusses the concept of derived functors in full generality.
For the dedicated discussion of the traditional case see at derived functors in homological algebra.
The relation to the general case is discussed below in the section In homological algebra.
For a dedicated discussion of this case see the entry derived functor in homological algebra.
In general, they contain too little information to accomplish this.
In general, it is just a derived functor.
A dedicated discussion of this case is at derived functors in homological algebra.
This is prop. 5.2.4.6 and remark 5.2.4.7 in (Lurie).
For more along these lines see also at Quillen adjunction - Associated infinity-adjunction.
Here put that special case a bit more into the general perspective.
Dually, a projective resolution is a cofibrant replacement in the projective model structure.
We can therefore ask about derived functors of Ch ‚Ä¢(F).
Left derived functors are dual, using the projective model structure.
In homological algebra one then speaks of hyper-derived functors.
The last step of taking cohomology groups serves to extract invariant and computable information.
It also destroys the simple composition law of functors, though.
Specifically, suppose we have a short exact sequence 0‚ÜíA‚ÜíB‚ÜíC‚Üí0 in ùíú.
All of this works without hypothesis on F.
The case of left exact functors and right derived functors is dual.
The (total) derived functor of the limit functor is the homotopy limit.
More generally, the total derived functor of Kan extension is homotopy Kan extension.

It uses the axiom of choice.
(K√∂nig) Let |X| be the cardinality of a set X.
Suppose we have proper inclusions f j:A j‚Ü™B j.
Now we prove the last inequality is strict.
Suppose to the contrary that there exists a surjective function f:‚àë iA i‚Üí‚àè iB i.
By supposition, there exists a‚àà‚àë iA i such that f(a)=(b j) j‚ààI.
We have 2 Œ∫=2 Œ∫√óŒ∫=(2 Œ∫) Œ∫.
Let f:‚àë iA i‚áÄ‚àè iB i.
We define a member m(f)‚àà‚àè iB i as m(f)(i)=n i(a‚Ü¶f(i,a)(i)).
This means that m(f)‚àà‚àè iB i‚àñim(f), as required.
For f:A‚áÄB, let n(f)=min{Œ±‚ààB‚à£Œ±‚àâim(f)}.
Then m(f‚Ä≤)‚ààB‚àñim(f‚Ä≤)‚äÜB‚àñim(f), so let n(f)=m(f‚Ä≤).
Locally on X the moduli space of generalized vielbeins is the coset G/H.
A convex cone is therefore a cone which is a convex space.
This gives the notion of right Kan lift.
A standard universality argument shows that Rift p thus defined is functorial.
Similarly, global left Kan lifts are left adjoint to postcomposition.
Other examples will be given below.
Then global right Kan lifts exist (as do global right Kan extensions).
There‚Äôs of course a dual definition in terms of absolute right Kan lifts.
However, for applications in string theory more refined versions of these theories matter.
See at orientifold for more on this.
Dually a co-character is a homomorphism out of k √ó into G.
Similarly the cocharacter lattice is Hom(k √ó,G).
For topological groups one considers continuous characters.
Write S 1 for the circle group.
Write [T,S 1] for its character group.
Such properties arise from characters occurring as traces of group representations.
This construction is useful in the generalisation to transchromatic characters.
Assuming the law of excluded middle, these are the only examples.
This includes, for example, the maximal continuous partial functions between two topological spaces.

This gives the following result.
In general limits do not commute with colimits.
But under a number of special conditions of interest they do.

However, that function (or its graph) is not in the model!
One can enlarge the model by adding the function (and more).
In fact, every regular epimorphism is a strong epimorphism, hence an extremal epimorphism.
This also follows from the theory of generalized kernels.
This is by definition of ‚Äúregular category‚Äù.
Proposition (in regular category pullback preserves effective epimorphisms)
(See Johnstone, A.1.3.4.)
Remark Regular epimorphisms are not generally closed under composition.
Taylor 1999 p. 289 gives the following example in Cat.
There is an evident regular epi e:‚Ñï‚Üí‚Ñ§/3 of monoids.
But the composite ùüö‚ÜíB‚Ñï‚ÜíBeB‚Ñ§/3 is not a regular epi in Cat.
In the category of sets, every epimorphism is regular.
Frequently, regular epimorphisms are a good choice.
In the category of groups, every epimorphism is regular.
Thus ‚Ñï‚Ü™‚Ñ§ is not a regular epimorphism.
The page epimorphism has a list of many types of epimorphism and their relationships.
The dual concept is regular monomorphism.
The last axiom is more difficult to interpret but is clarified by some examples.

These may be thought of as generalized cohomology groups (exmpl.).
Moreover, in part 1.2 we discussed the symmetric monoidal smash product of spectra X‚àßY.
The concept of spectral sequence is what formalizes this idea.
This is meant as motivation and warmup.
Let X be a topological space and A‚Ü™X a topological subspace.
So the boundary vanishes possibly only ‚Äúup to contributions coming from A‚Äù.
We look at some concrete fundamental examples in a moment.
Let X still be a given topological space.
Accordingly the reduced homology of the point vanishes in every degree: HÀú ‚Ä¢(*)‚âÉ0.
Moreover, it is clear that œµ:C 0(*)‚Üí‚Ñ§ is the identity map.
Now we can discuss the relation between reduced homology and relative homology.
It remains to deal with the case in degree 0.
This implies that H 0(x) is an injection.
This is indeed true under mild conditions:
It needs the proof of the Excision property of relative homology.
While important, here we will not further dwell on this.
The interested reader can find more information behind the above links.
Moreover the boundary inclusion is a good pair in the sense of def. .
Therefore the example follows with prop. .
The wedge sum of two pointed circles is the ‚Äúfigure 8‚Äù-topological space.
The following basic facts about the singular homology of CW complexes are important.
First we observe the following.
This implies the first claims by induction on n.
And in this greater generality the concept is of great practical relevance.
We say that element of G pC ‚Ä¢ are in filtering degree p.
Accordingly we have (p,q)-cycles and -boundaries.
These are still differentials: ‚àÇ 2=0. Proof
One says in this cases that the spectral sequence degenerates at r s.
One says in this case that the spectral sequence collapses on this page.
Therefore if all but one row or column vanish, then all these differentials vanish.
This says what these spectral sequences are converging to.
For computations it is also important to know how they start out for low r.
Comparing cellular and singular homology
So the statement follows with prop. .
But for the present purpose we stick with the simpler special case of def. .
There is no condition on the morphisms in def. .
Next we turn to extracting information from this sequence of sequences.
This we discuss in detail in part 2 ‚Äì Adams spectral sequences.

Hence exp(‚àíŒ±2Œì ab)v^exp(Œ±2Œì ab)=exp(12[Œì ab,‚àí])(v^) is the rotation action as claimed.
This kernel reflects the ambiguity from remark .
This is called the Feynman slash notation.
With this equation (17) is checked explicitly.
Recall the Minkowski inner product Œ∑ on ‚Ñù p,1, given by prop./def. .
Its boundary is the light cone.
These are then equivalently configurations on the 4-sphere.
Therefore classifying and counting instantons amounts to classifying and counting G-principal bundles.
This is the case of ‚ÄúBPST-instantons‚Äù.
This is the 4-sphere S 4‚âÉ‚Ñù 4‚à™{‚àû}.
There is a classifying space for SU(2)-principal bundles, denoted BSU(2).
We see below that Chern-Weil theory identifies this number with the instanton number.
Therefore this class completely characterizes SU(2)-principal bundles in 4d.
Constructing instantons from gauge transformations
Topologically this is homeomorphic to the situation before, and hence just as good.
Gauge fields vanishing at infinity
Now we bring in connections.
As discussed before, we may just as well consider any principal connection.
Counting instantons by integrating tr(F ‚àá‚àßF ‚àá)
But beware that this is only true on a single chart.
Put this way this should be very obvious now.
That this is so is given to us by Chern-Weil theory.
In fact the full story is nicer still.
This is the Chern-Simons 2-gerbe of the gauge field.

The first one is a tad more detailed.
The second one briefly attributes the construction to Weil, without reference.)
Here we describe some introdutcory basics of the general theory in concrete terms.
See ‚àû-Chern-Weil theory ‚Äì motivation for some motivation.
These are the special cases that this introduction concentrates on.
But we get a bit more, even.
We shall write BG‚ààLieGrpd for BG regarded as equipped with this smooth structure.
Its cartoon description is simply X={x‚Üíidx}.
To this is canonically associated the Cech groupoid C({U i}).
The triangle in the above cartoon symbolizes the evident way in which these morphisms compose.
hence also C(U) becomes a Lie groupoid.
There is a canonical functor C({U i})‚ÜíX:(x,i)‚Ü¶x.
For the moment we shall be content with accepting this as an ad hoc statement.
We may think of PÀú as being P.
It is a particular representative of P in the (‚àû,1)-topos of Lie groupoids.
And it is equivalent to ‚àûGrpd, the (‚àû,1)-category of bare ‚àû-groupoids.
We now discuss the case where G is generalized to a Lie 2-group.
This is the first step towards higher Chern-Weil theory.
Write U(1)=‚Ñù/‚Ñ§ for the circle group.
We have already seen above the groupoid BU(1) obtained from this.
This makes it what is called a 2-group.
Let again X be a smooth manifold with good open cover {U i‚ÜíX}.
These will model direct morphisms X‚ÜíB 2U(1) in the (‚àû,1)-topos.
Let g:C(U)‚ÜíB 2U(1) be a Cech cocycle as above.
This is a groupoid central extension BU(1)‚ÜíP‚ÜíC(U)‚âÉX.
This is clearly the beginning of a pattern.
A cocycle C(U)‚ÜíB 3U(1) classifies a circle 3-bundle .
Above we saw BU(1)-principal 2-bundles.
These groupoids PÀú are in the literature known as nonabelian bundle gerbe.
Finally the general theory of principal ‚àû-bundles deals with smooth ‚àû-groupoids.
A comprehensive discussion of such ‚àû-Lie groupoids is given there.
See also models for ‚àû-stack (‚àû,1)-toposes.
These are called the simplicial identities.
These in turn need to be connected by pentagonators and ever so on.
But we need a bit more than just bare ‚àû-groupoids.
In generalization to Lie groupoids, we need ‚àû-Lie groupoids.
This is equivalently a simplicial presheaf of sets.
This is sometimes called an ‚àû-anafunctor from X to Y.
What is the general abstract concept of an ‚àû-connection?
What are its defining abstract properties?
With that in hand we then revisit the discussion of connections on ordinary bundles.
There are different equivalent definitions of the classical notion of a connection.
(Constructions and results in this section are from ([SWI]).
This induces a natural morphism BG conn‚ÜíBG that forgets the 1-forms.
This is equivalent to the traditional definitions.
(Constructions and results in this section are from SWII, SWIII)
We do not state the last definition for general Lie 2-groups G.
This case is important in itself and discussed in detail below.
So BG diff is a resolution of BG.
Pseudo-connections in themselves are not very interesting.
This inclusion plays a central role in the theory.
This is the kind of situation that resolutions are needed for.
This happens to be an exact sequence of 2-groupoids.
The top morphisms are the components of the presheaf BU(1).
The top squares are those of BU(1) diff.
This represents the first Chern class of the bundle in de Rham cohomology.
This is content that appeared partly in (SSSIII, FSS).
We restrict attention to the circle n-group G=B n‚àí1U(1).
This is a cocycle in Cech-Deligne cohomology.
We may think of this as encoding a circle n-bundle with connection.
The forms (C i) are the local connection n-forms.
And this is defined fully intrinsically.
This is what we turn to now.
A general strategy for studying nonabelian ‚àû-bundles therefore is to approximate them by abelian bundles.
This is achieved by considering characteristic classes.
In some cases such an assignment may be obtained by integration of infinitesimal data.
If so, then the assignment refines to one of ‚àû-bundles with connection.
For general G we call it the ‚àû-Chern-Weil homomorphism.
Consider the unitary group U(N).
This construction directly extends to the case where the bundles carry connections.
Let (P‚ÜíX,‚àá) be a Spin(N)-principal bundle with connection.
Therefore the key observation is that we have a Deligne cocycle at all.
This can be checked directly, if somewhat tediously, by hand.
But then the question remains: where does this successful Ansatz come from?
In prop. we reproduce the above example.
The construction proceeds in the following broad steps
Its CE-algebra is the de Rham complex CE(TX)=Œ© ‚Ä¢(X).
One finds that it makes
More elegantly said: locally constant sheaves are the sections of constant stacks:
Then the constant stack on C is the stackification const¬Ø C:Op(X) op‚ÜíGrpd.
Let (Œî‚ä£Œì):‚Ñ∞‚ÜíŒì‚ÜêŒîùíÆ be the global section geometric morphism of a topos ‚Ñ∞ over base ùíÆ.
Without further assumption on ‚Ñ∞ we have the following definition.
In this case the above definition is equivalent to the following one.
Let ‚Ñ∞=Sh(C) be a locally connected topos.
Locally constant sheaves are sheaves of sections of covering spaces.
When used as coefficient objects in cohomology they are also called local systems.
This is the content of Galois theory.

Note that the notion of factorization system is self-dual.
In other words, the regular image is the equalizer of the cokernel pair.
Suppose that M 1 and M 2 are two classes with M 1‚äÜM 2.
There are several properties we might want a ‚Äòhigher image‚Äô to have.

Starting from a finite group G, consider the set I=G‚àê{m}.
Unless stated otherwise, we assume the ground field of TY(G) to be ‚ÑÇ.

TY(G) is not necessarily unique for a choice of G.
Proposition TY(G) is a unitary fusion category.
This follows from (Galindo & Hong & Rowell 2013, theorem 5.20).
All 8 of these unitary braided fusion categories (UBFCs) are modular.

It is not Boolean.
By Diaconescu's theorem, SimpSet therefore does not satisfy the axiom of choice.
Moreover, natural numbers object is simply the discrete simplicial set of ordinary natural numbers.
Similarly, it satisfies Markov's principle.
Every abelian group is a commutative loop.
In this case it is the category M-Set.
Here are some initial questions we hope to better understand:

How does one calculate finite products in M-Set/Set M?
So let‚Äôs do it!

It is related to the notion of classical subdivision.
We will briefly look at one such example later.
For simplicial complexes Barycentric subdivision is easiest to define for simplicial complexes.
A vertex of Sd(X) is a simplex of X.
This is what it looks like for X the 2-simplex.
The subdivided simplex therefore is the flags of that poset.
We can now define the barycentric subdivision of a simplicial set as follows.
Recall that we can make any simplicial complex into a simplicial set.
A review is for instance around (Fiore-Paoli def. 3.1).
This functorial subdivision corresponds to the classical barycentric subdivision.
Other classical subdivisions that are frequently encountered include the middle edge subdivision.
This latter is closely related to the ordinal subdivision of simplicial sets.
Crystalline cohomology serves to refine the notion of de Rham cohomology for schemes.

This is more commonly known as the presentation axiom: PAx.
It is a weak form of the axiom of choice.
This should be read in view of the definition of projective objects:
Hence: There are enough projectives.
This is discussed in more detail here.
Equivalently, internal DC and internal CC follow from internal CoSHEP.
Proof Condition 1 easily implies 2.
Let p:P‚ÜíX be a projective cover.
(Compare with the internal axiom of choice: every object is internally projective.)
Suppose that 1 is (externally) projective in E.
Then E satisfies PAx whenever it satisfies internal PAx.
Internal PAx does not follows from external PAx; see Counterexample 5.3.
Then stably projective objects are internally projective (proof?).
The objects C(‚àí,a),C(‚àí,b), and G are subterminal and G‚âÖC(‚àí,a)‚à©C(‚àí,b)‚âÖC(‚àí,a)√óC(‚àí,b).
Thus the map e P:F P‚ÜíG P cannot be epic.

This entry is about the concept of distributional densities in functional analysis.
For the concept in differential geometry and Lie theory see at distribution of subspaces.
Various immediate variants of this definition may be considered.
We first recall the Traditional definition.
Distributions come in various flavors, depending on what spaces of functions they act on.
The widest (and generally the default) notion is as follows.
Often one writes ‚ü®S,œï‚ü© instead of S(œï).
As C c ‚àû(U) is reflexive, this agrees with the weak topology.
(see also H√∂r#mander 90, below def. 2.1.1).
These are functionals on C ‚àû(U) (test functions without compact support).
This is hence called the pullback of distributions.
Let X be a smooth manifold.
This is discussed at distributions are the smooth linear functionals.
Then we want F ‚Ä†(Œπœï)=Œπ(F(œï)).
If the extension exists, we have F ‚Ä†(Œπœï)(œà)=Œπ(F(œï))(œà)=‚ü®F(œï),œà‚ü©
But if F + does exist then we have F ‚Ä†(Œπœï)(œà)=‚ü®F(œï),œà‚ü©=‚ü®œï,F +(œà)‚ü©
Otherwise extending operators becomes complex.
Two instances are of particular importance: Multiplication by a smooth function Œ∏.
Thus we define Œ∏‚ãÖS by ‚ü®Œ∏‚ãÖS,œà‚ü©=‚ü®S,Œ∏‚ãÖœà Differentiation.
Thus derivatives of distributions are defined to all orders.
Some examples are given in the section ‚Äúexamples‚Äù.
See at multiplication of distributions
As explained above, any locally integrable function on U defines a distribution on U.
As a distribution, the Heaviside measure is the famous Dirac distribution.
Meanwhile, H(x) is itself the derivative of a continuous function: G(x)=max{x,0}.
(As a functional, it maps a test function œï to ‚àíœï‚Ä≤(0).)
These examples are by no means curiosities.
See also operator-valued distribution and Wightman axioms.
Distribution theory has also long been used in the theory of partial differential equations.
A proof is given in these notes by Helgason.
Then u=f*T is smooth.
The existence of a fundamental solution involves a theorem of Paley-Wiener type.
This is discussed in (Moerdijk-Reyes 91).
Examples of models that support these axioms are the toposes ùíµ and ‚Ñ¨ described there.
See V. Guillemin, S. Sternberg: Geometric asymptotics (free online).
Usually they are called currents.
Most well known are the theory of hyperfunctions and the theory of Coulombeau distributions.

Differentiably good covers are useful for computations.
Their full impact is however on the homotopy theory of simplicial presheaves over CartSp.
(every open cover has refinement by a differentially good open cover)
Remark Lemma is not quite a classical statement.
The good open covers do not yet form a Grothendieck topology on CartSp.
So this is a good open cover of ‚Ñù 2.
But it has an evident refinement by a good open cover.
This is a special case of what the following statement says in generality.
Hence CartSp equipped with this coverage is a site (this def.).
This is evidently an open cover, albeit not necessarily a good open cover.
By example this good open cover coverage is not a Grothendieck topology.

In the section Coordinate systems we have set up the archetypical spaces of differential geometry.
In particular we do not assume that we know beforehand a set of points underlying X.
The following definitions spell this out.
This is what the following definition formalises.
Let X be a pre-smooth set, def. .
In particular the real line ‚Ñù is this way itself a smooth set.
Some smooth sets are far from being like smooth manifolds:
We introduce and discuss this example in detail in more detail below
In order to say this we first need a formalization of homomorphism of smooth sets.
This we turn to now.
Let X and Y be two smooth sets, def. .
The following proposition says that these two superficially different notions actually naturally coincide.
Let X,Y‚ààSmoothSet by two smooth sets.
With a bit of work this is straightforward to check explicitly by unwinding the definitions.
This we come to below in Smooth sets - Semantic Layer.
The latter we may regard as a K-parameterized smooth family of smooth functions Œ£‚ÜíX.
Combine prop. with prop. .
But PX also knows how to smoothly vary such smooth trajectories.
This is central for variational calculus which determines equations of motion in physics.
This we turn to below in Variational calculus.
This perspective allows to see good abstract properties enjoyed by the smooth sets.
This is a straightforward matter of matching definitions.
Therefore the statement follows by the comparison lemma (this prop.).
By Prop. we have an equivalence of categories SmoothSet‚âÉSh(SmoothManifold).
The local objects with respect to this set are manifestly exactly the constant presheaves.
This establishe a full subcategory-inclusion DiffeologicalSpace‚Ü™Sh(EuclOp).

So far we have defined differential n-form on abstract coordinate systems.
We call this the universal smooth moduli space of differential n-forms.
This we do in a moment in remark .
Notice that differential 0-forms are equivalently smooth ‚Ñù-valued functions.
This statement is of course in a way a big tautology.
Nevertheless it is a very useful tautology to make explicit.
We discuss the smooth space of differential forms on a fixed smooth space X.
This is captured by the following definition.

Once again, all simplicial objects in chain complexes are Reedy cofibrant.
Consider topological spaces with weak homotopy equivalences.
Below, we use the Serre model structure.
The topological simplex Œî:Œî‚ÜíTop is Reedy cofibrant as a cosimplicial topological space.
However, we can pass to the semisimplicial setting, as explained above.
In this, case Reedy cofibrancy boils down to the objectwise cofibrancy.

If these bimodules come from algebra homomorphisms then the sesquialgebra is a bialgebra.

With AC, it is a trivial corollary of the well-ordering theorem.
We prove that the Cantor‚ÄìSchroeder‚ÄìBernstein theorem holds in a Boolean topos.
(This can be formalized via the Mitchell‚ÄìBenabou language, for instance.)
First, let‚Äôs try a little pedagogy.
How can we achieve this?
Since A‚â§T for every T in U, we have œï(A)‚â§œï(T)‚â§T for every T in U.
Applying œï again, we get œïœï(A)‚â§œï(A).
Hence œï(A) belongs to U.
Here the initial algebra A is (by construction) an initial fixed point.
Suppose given two monos f:X‚ÜíY, g:Y‚ÜíX.
The second line makes sense because ¬¨A is in the image of g.
This classic proof is substantially the proof given in Johnstone‚Äôs Elephant, D4.1.11.
But that being said, EM is certainly the most natural supposition to make.
A proof that in a topos CSB+NNO implies Booleanness is outlined in Freyd 1994.
Naturally the left adjoint ‚àÉ f also preserves such colimits.
Elements in A 1 are those which have no inverse images under g.
Other prescriptions are possible.
This implies that CSB holds for homotopy types/‚àû-groupoids.

The statement of Frobenius reciprocity then equivalently reads like this: ‚àëf(X‚äóf *Y)‚âÉ(‚àëfX)‚äóY.

I‚Äôm going to take a different approach to this question.
This space is a manifold, in whatever sense you wish.
It is also a submanifold of LM, and actually has a tubular neighbourhood.
So it‚Äôs as nice as you can get!
So our first generalisation is to allow that coincidence to move.
This is LM√óS 1√óS 1.
Next, we consider the subset of these triples that satisfy f(p)=f(q) and p‚â†q.
I claim that this is a manifold.
Let us label this space as W.
The target is {(f,p,q):‚Ñúp>12,‚Ñúq<‚àí12}.
But that‚Äôs not actually as simple as it might seem.
But if we destroy the labelled coincidence, what do we do with our label?
The reason is simple, but perhaps a little surprising.
This is Ryan‚Äôs objection.
We cannot fix this.
So the space in question is most emphatically not a submanifold.

Let BG be the delooping groupoid of the group G.

This constitutes what is sometimes called the language of categories.
This we turn to further below.
But not all categories are ‚Äúconcrete‚Äù in this way.
Let ùíû be a category (Def. ).
Clearly, these are small categories (Def. ).
Let (S,‚â§) be a preordered set.
In fact every groupoid with precisely one object is of the form.
Let ùíû be a category.
This relation is known as formal duality.
Let ùíû and ùíü be two categories (Def. ).
Accordingly, this composition is unital and associative.
Let ùíû be a category (Def. ).
This is called the full subcategory of ùíû on the objects in S.
See at structure for more on this.
Notice that the formal Cartesian spaces ‚Ñù n|q are fully defined by this assignment.

Conversely, f is called the adjunct of fÀú.
It happens that there are subsequence adjoint functors:
Below in Example we identify adjoint triples as adjunctions of adjunctions.
Similarly there are adjoint quadruples, etc.
This is clearly already the defining condition on the floor function ‚åäx‚åã.
This is evidently already the defining condition on the floor function ‚åäx‚åã.
Here the logical implications are equivalently functions between sets that are either empty or singletons.
But Functions between such sets are unique, when they exist.
These hence form an adjoint triple (Remark ) Disc‚ä£U‚ä£coDisc.
We now consider a sequence of equivalent reformulations of the condition of adjointness.
The converse formula follows analogously.
The argument for the naturality of œµ is directly analogous.
Hence it remains to show the converse.
We consider one more equivalent characterization of adjunctions:
In one direction, assume a left adjoint L is given.
Then the statement that this really is a universal arrow is implied by Prop. .
In the other direction, assume that universal arrows Œ∑ c are given.
There is a canonical functor F/c ‚ü∂ ùíü.
The other case is directly analogous.
Suppose that R 1,R 2:ùíû‚Üíùíü are two functors which both are right adjoint to L.
We consider the first case, the second is formally dual (Example ).
Next let c 1‚Ü™fc 2 be a monomorphism.
But the main preservation property of adjoint functors is that adjoints preserve (co-)limits.
Let ùíû be a strict 2-category (Def. ).
and composition is given by the evident compositions in ùíû.
These are also called strict 2-functors.
This is called an equivalence of categories (Def. below).
Let ùíû, ùíü be two categories (Def. ).
Let ùíüAA‚ä•AA‚ü∂R‚üµLùíû be a pair of adjoint functors (Def. ).
The second claim is formally dual.
In conclusion, we have the following three equivalent perspectives on modalities.
-consider the concept of reflective subcategories from the point of view of modalities:
Let ùíü be a category (Def. ).
Let ùíü be a category (Def. ).

The irreflexivity condition means there is never an edge from a node to itself.
The elements of V are called vertices, the elements of A are called arcs.
Some useful examples of digraphs are based on ordinals:
We call this an ordinal digraph and denote it by the ordinal itself.
Suppose D=(V,A) is a digraph.
However, the arc-set functor Dgr(2,‚àí):Dgr‚ÜíSet is very far from being faithful.
Unwinding the definitions, here is an elementary description of such walks:
The phrase Œ±-vertex path means any path whose domain is Œ±.
Some special cases: If Œ±=0, then P is called the empty walk.
The category Dgr is not especially well-behaved for a category theorist.
In both cases the culprit is the irreflexivity condition.
It does however have products indexed over nonempty sets, and equalizers.
We begin with plain monomorphisms.
It is well-known that faithful functors U reflect monomorphisms and epimorphisms.
The argument for epimorphisms is dual.
Suppose D=(V,A) is a digraph.
A path in D is a walk P:Œ±‚ÜíD whose underlying function is injective.
Or what is the same, that Dgr(1,P) is a monomorphism in Set.
Suppose D=(V,A) is a digraph.
We have the following easy result.
In a digraph D, every path is a trail.
A cycle in D is just an n-cycle in D for some n.
A digraph D is acyclic if it admits no cycles.
The map q induces a bijection on arcs: Dgr(2,q):Dgr(2,{0,‚Ä¶,n})‚Üí‚àºDgr(2,Z n).
A slick method for doing this is by invoking a ‚Äúsymmetrizing‚Äù functor construction.
Theorem The functor Symm carries an idempotent monad structure.
Similarly Symm(u D) is also an identity map: u Symm(D)=Symm(u D).
The associativity of m follows by inverting a naturality square for u.
A weak cycle Z n‚ÜíD is defined to be a cycle Z n‚ÜíSymm(D).
Suppose D=(V,A) is a digraph and v‚ààV.
Suppose D=(V,A) is a digraph and v‚ààV.
The out-degree is defined analogously.
The axiom implies‚Äîdigraphs being irreflexive‚Äî that always ¬¨(P(i)=P(i+1)).
This walk has a two-element image.
Suppose D=(V,A) is a digraph.
Suppose Œ±‚ÜíPV is a non-empty walk in D.
Then P(0) is called the start vertex of P.
Suppose that A,B are subsets of V, not necessarily disjoint.
Suppose D=(V,A) is a digraph.
A usual abbreviation in combinatorics for acyclic directed graph is DAG.
Here, ‚Äúclassical‚Äù refers to the negative definition.
The set of all weak cycles of a digraph D is denoted WeCy(D).
Then z(P) witnesses P‚Äòs not being a cycle.
Suppose D=(V,A) is a digraph.
By definition, for each k‚ààœâ, each k-(co)king is an œâ-(co)king.
Of course, a vertex can be a king and a coking simultaneously.
Here we make no such restriction (cf. ).
In combinatorics, this is sometimes referred to as an infinite star.
Suppose D=(V,A) is a plane digraph.
A face of D is a member of the set Fa(D).
Each face of D is an open connected subspace of the plane.
Of course one needs a map from plane digraphs to (abstract) digraphs:

Then f has a unique fixed point.
Then for every x‚ààA, we have f(t)‚â§f(x)‚â§x, hence f(t)‚â§t.
We therefore also have f(f(t))‚â§f(t), so that f(t)‚ààA.
But then it follows that t‚â§f(t), whence t=f(t).
Clearly this t is a least fixed point of f.)
Then the principal upward-closed set s‚Üë generated by s is a complete lattice.
A virtual corollary of this theorem is the Cantor-Schroeder-Bernstein theorem.
Then the restriction f:S‚ÜíS satisfies 1 S‚â§f, i.e., f is inflationary.
It follows that f‚àòt‚â§t, but also t‚â§f‚àòt since f is inflationary.
So f‚àòt=t, and in particular t(‚ä•)‚ààS is a fixed point of f.
This t(‚ä•) is a least fixed point of f:L‚ÜíL.

By assumption, colimG exists in C, and this colimit is preserved by F.
(To be continued.)
Then the category of F-algebras is also locally presentable.
In particular, there exists an initial F-algebra.
This is the colimit of D in Fix(F), as is easily checked.
Therefore Fix(F) is cocomplete and accessible.
This too can be ‚Äúcategorified‚Äù (to be continued).
Here ‚Äúidempotent‚Äù involves a coassociativity condition.

The reflexive completion is idempotent: ‚Ñõ(‚Ñõ(A))‚âÉ‚Ñõ(A).
The reflexive completion is Cauchy complete.

A‚Üí‚Ñõ(A) creates limits and colimits.

Any distributive lattice, regarded as a thin category, is coherent.
The category of PERs over a PCA is coherent.
Any coherent category automatically has a strict initial object.
Extensivity is the analogue for coherent categories of exactness for regular categories.
A coherent category which is both extensive and exact is called a pretopos.
Equivalently, they are generated by single regular epimorphisms and by finite unions of subobjects.
(In fact, the coherent topology is superextensive.)

Conversely, if x 2=y, then x is a square root of y.
(See Richman (1998).)
This is important for interpreting the quadratic formula.
In other words, a‚áí‚àí must be right adjoint to ‚àí‚àßa.
This is equivalent to the following definition.
The implication a‚áíb is the exponential object b a.
Hence we can speak of an internal Heyting algebra in any category with products.
Proposition Any Heyting algebra is a distributive lattice.
That is, finite meets distribute over finite joins and vice versa.
This is a straightforward exercise applying the universal property (1).
(‚àí‚áía)‚áía is a monad.
From Proposition it is immediate that this describes both a‚áí‚àí and (‚àí‚áía)‚áía.
We collect some further frequently-useful facts:
Currying: ¬¨(x‚àßy)=(x‚áí¬¨y).
These also imply the De Morgan law.
We saw in that ¬¨¬¨ is a monad.
Further: Lemma Double negation ¬¨¬¨:L‚ÜíL preserves finite meets.
Proof Nullary meets are trivial: ¬¨¬¨1=¬¨0=1.
For binary meets, the direction ¬¨¬¨(x‚àßy)‚â§(¬¨¬¨x)‚àß(¬¨¬¨y) holds simply because ¬¨¬¨ is monotone.
Applying (3) and currying (by ), we have ¬¨¬¨(a‚áíb)=¬¨((¬¨¬¨a)‚àß(¬¨b))=(¬¨¬¨a‚áí(¬¨b‚áí0))=(¬¨¬¨a‚áí¬¨¬¨b).
Note that a Grothendieck (0,1)-topos is a frame or locale.
In a Heyting category, every subobject poset Sub(A) is a Heyting algebra.
In particular, this holds for every topos.
In a boolean topos, the internal Heyting algebras are all internal boolean algebras.
Similarly, we get the double negation sublocale of any locale.
One of the chief sources of Heyting algebras is given by topologies.
Thus frames are extensionally the same thing as complete Heyting algebras.
Another example is the topology of a discrete space X.
By , double negation ¬¨¬¨:L‚ÜíL is a monad.
Further, by , it preserves finite meets.
Write Œπ:L ¬¨¬¨‚ÜíL for the right adjoint, so that M=Œπ‚àòU.
Because Œπ is full, it reflects meets.
Therefore U=¬¨¬¨:L‚ÜíL ¬¨¬¨ is a Heyting algebra quotient which is the coequalizer of 1,¬¨¬¨:L‚Üí‚ÜíL.
Thus ¬¨¬¨:L‚ÜíL ¬¨¬¨ preserves finite joins and finite meets and implication.
In other words, we have the following result.
In a Heyting algebra H, the elements 0 and 1 are clearly complemented.
Thus the complemented elements form a Heyting subalgebra Comp(H)‚Ü™H.
In other words, every topos is a Heyting category.

We have to produce an I‚ààPropIdl(R) such that for all c‚ààC then c‚äÇI.
We claim that such I is provided by the union: I‚âî‚à™J‚ààùíûJ.
There are thus J 1,J 2‚ààùíû with x 1‚ààJ 1 and x 2‚ààJ 2.
We may assume the former without restriction, otherwise rename 1‚Üî2.

Different (but related) is physical unit.
This is the sense of ‚Äúunit‚Äù in terms such as nonunital ring.
Exactly what this means depends on context.
Accordingly, a unit in a monoid may be defined in precisely the same way.
A group is precisely a monoid in which every element is a unit.
This is the same as a generator of M as an R-module.
There is no need to distinguish left and right units unless M is a bimodule.
Then we usually also require a unit of measurement to be positive.
In particular, u itself does.
So a is an identity.
Why is a an identity then?
But without commutativity (and associativity), this doesn't work.

Properties The integers form a commutative ring.
The integers have decidable equality and decidable order.
The integers are a strictly ordered ring and a pseudolattice ordered ring.
The integers are a metric space and a normed space.
The integers are a Euclidean domain
The integers satisfy the Archimedean property, making it into an Archimedean integral domain.
The integers are in bijection with the natural numbers.
Let x:‚Ñï‚Üí‚Ñ§ be a sequence of integers, and let b:‚Ñ§ be an integer.
This relation is a functional relation, making the integers a sequentially Hausdorff space.
This relation is a functional relation, making the integers a Hausdorff space.
Let Œ© be the type of all propositions, so that the foundations is impredicative.
There are no other Dedekind cuts on the integers.
Thus, the integers are Dedekind complete.
The only other Dedekind complete Archimedean integral domain is the Dedekind real numbers ‚Ñù.
The underlying sets ‚Ñ§ and ‚Ñï are isomorphic.
Translations can also cause confusion with the term ‚Äòwhole number‚Äô.

Some subclasses of examples of structures in mathematics are fully combinatorial in their nature.
For example, there are so called combinatorial games in game theory.
Here we introduce and explain all this.
This allows to speak of commutative algebra internal to tensor categories.
Specializing this to the tensor category of super vector spaces yields supercommutative superalgebras.
The formal duals of these are the affine super schemes.
This we discuss in Commutative algebra in tensor categories and Affine super-spaces
This we discuss in Modules in tensor categories and Super vector bundles
We introduce the basics in Super Fiber functors and their automorphism supergroups
This is the category inside which linear algebra takes place.
Of course the category Vect has some special properties.
This is traditionally captured by the following terminology for additive and abelian categories.
Let ùíû be a category (this Def.).
We write V‚äïW for the direct sum of two objects of ùíû.
Recall the basic construction of the tensor product of vector spaces:
This defines a category, denoted Vect G.
A key such property is commutativity.
We will see below that this is the very source of superalgebra.
As in example , this definition makes ‚Ñ§/2 a monoidal category def. .
(See at looping and delooping).
We write k 1|0 and k 0|1 for these, respectively.
Write LineÀú(Vect ‚Ñ§/2) for the resulting 2-group.
One finds (‚Ä¶) H 4(K(‚Ñ§/2,3),‚Ñ§/2)‚âÉ‚Ñ§/2.
The following is evident but important
We now discuss one more extra property on monoidal categories
We say that A * is the right dual object to A.
There are slight variants of what people mean by a ‚Äútensor category‚Äù.
In this form this is considered in (Deligne 02, 0.1).
We consider now various types of size constraints on tensor categories.
Let ùíû be an abelian category.
It has a single isomorphism class of simple objects, namely k itself.
Also category of finite dimensional super vector spaces is a finite tensor category.
This is made precise by def. and def. below.
This duality between certain spaces and their algebras of functions is profound.
In the physics literature, such spaces are usually just called superspaces.
We now make this precise.
Similarly a commutative monoid in Vect is an ordinary commutative algebra.
Moreover, in both cases the homomorphisms of monoids agree with usual algebra homomorphisms.
Hence there are equivalences of categories.
Example motivates the following definition:
Hence the heart of superalgebra is super-commutativity.
We also denote this algebra by ‚àß ‚Ñù ‚Ä¢(‚Ñù n)‚ààsCAlg ‚Ñù.
Hence this regards a commutative algebra as a superalgebra concentrated in even degree.
We write sLieAlg for the resulting category of super Lie algebras.
This makes it immediate how to generalize to super L-infinity algebras:
Explicitly this means the following:
Now def. is equivalent to the following def. .
see at signs in supergeometry for more on this).
(If they are, then they are Weil algebras).
This is not equivalent to the concept in def. . Example
These are often called ‚Ñ§-graded commutative algebras.
See at the chapter on homotopy types the section Categories of chain complexes.
The following relation between ‚Ñ§-grading and ‚Ñ§/2-grading is elementary but important.
Proof It is clear that the functor (‚àí)| 0,1 is essentially surjective.
Hence we need to see that it is fully faithful.
Hence (‚àí)| 0,1 is fully faithful.
See at spectral super-scheme for more.
It is immediate to see by direct inspection that per is a faithful functor.
This is clearly an epimorphism, but not a monomorphism, hence not an isomorphism.
We also call this the affine scheme of A.
We also call this the algebra of functions on X. Definition
See at geometry of physics ‚Äì supergeometry for more on this.
Monoids are preserved by lax monoidal functors:
A key such construction is that of vector bundles over X.
Write Œì X(V) for the set of all such sections.
Observe that this set inherits various extra structure.
This hence yields a new section c 1œÉ 1+c 2œÉ 2.
Hence the set of sections of a vector bundle naturally forms itself a vector space.
But there is more structure.
This operation enjoys some evident properties.
These ‚Äúgeneralized vector bundles‚Äù are called ‚Äúquasicoherent sheaves‚Äù over affines.
We now state the relevant definitions and constructions formally.
The action property holds due to lemma .

Every line bundle is slope-stable.
The extension of a degree-0 line bundle by a degree-1 line bundle is stable.
The archetypical example of these is the stable (infinity,1)-category of spectra of topological spaces.
For topological spaces there is the classical notion of Postnikov system.
Postnikov systems are also used to define generalizations of stability conditions in triangulated setup.
We call f‚ààK[X]‚àí{0} separable if it has no multiple zero in K¬Ø.
A subfield K‚äÇL‚äÇK¬Ø is called separable over K if each Œ±‚ààL is separable over K.
The separable closure K S of K is defined by K S‚âÉ{x‚ààK¬Ø|xisseparableoverK}.
From xyz it follows that the inclusion K‚äÇK S is Galois.
The Galois group Gal(K S/K) is called the absolute Galois group of K.
The aim is to follow matrix conventions in writing double compositions.
The implications of this advantage for weak category theory seem not to have been investigated.

See the Catlab for the theory of this structure.
We write C 0 for the set of objects of a small category C.
We claim that this defines a model structure.
Suppose first that p is acyclic.
It remains to prove the factorization axioms.
Note that the two factorizations constructed above are in fact functorial.
This result justifies the term ‚Äúcanonical‚Äù.
Let M denote any model structure on Cat whose weak equivalences are categorical equivalences.
Each acyclic M-fibration is a canonical acyclic fibration.
General facts about Galois connections may then be applied.
Every canonical cofibration is an M-cofibration.
Every M-fibration is a canonical fibration.
Let r:UA‚Üí2 be a retraction of the injection 2‚ÜíUA.
Thus we have a composite cofibration t‚âîŒ∑ E‚àòg:K(2)‚ÜíKU(E).

This supplies the lifting of cofibrations against acyclic fibrations.
Is there a dual model structure in which all categories are cofibrant?

Write c:Set‚ÜísSet for the inclusion of sets as discrete objects into simplicial sets.
This appears originally in section 12 of (Rezk).
Equivalently one can replace here the spine inclusions with the inner horn inclusions.

As usual, the positive and negative formulations are equivalent in a suitable sense.

Relations between gauge fields and strings present an old, fascinating and unanswered question.
The full answer to this question is of great importance for theoretical physics.
Moreover, in the SU(N) gauge theory the strings interaction is weak at large N.
The challenge is to build a precise theory on the string side of this duality.
This is, however, very different from the picture of strings as flux lines.
Interestingly, even now people often don‚Äôt distinguish between these approaches.

One formalization of this idea is that of a Grothendieck universe.
If the universe U is understood, we may simply say small and moderate.
In other words, every set is small if your universe is large enough!
Conversely, every such V Œ∫ is a Grothendieck universe.
Please see universe in a topos.
Thus, we can find a sequence U 1‚ààU 2‚ààU 3‚àà‚Ä¶ of universes.
Every U-small category is locally U-small.
Let C be a U-small category.
(USet itself is the special case of this where C is the point.)
Now let C be a U-moderate category (and not small).
However, it is locally U-moderate.

Idea Embeddings of differentiable manifolds are submanifold inclusions.
As a concrete examples, consider the function (sin(2‚àí),sin(‚àí)):(‚àíœÄ,œÄ)‚ü∂‚Ñù 2.
says that this is twice the dimension of the manifolds to be embedded.
This is an immersion.
Hence it remains to see that it is also an embedding of topological spaces.
There are two parts to showing that this space is contractible.
The first is showing that it is not empty.
The second is to exhibit a contraction.
Showing that it is not empty is a partition of unity argument.
The key property is the existence of a shift map.
Let M be a smooth manifold.
Let V be an infinite dimensional locally convex topological vector space.
The more general case will follow from that.
We define œà:M‚ÜíV by composing this with the inclusion ‚Ñù (‚àû)‚ÜíV.
We claim that this is an embedding.
The first thing to show is that it is continuous.
Then there is some i such that x‚ààU i.
The next thing to show is that it is injective.
Suppose that x,y‚ààM are such that œà(x)=œà(y).
This means that x and y lie in the domain of the chart œï i.
Moreover, as œà(x)=œà(y), we must have œà i(x)=œà i(y).
We want to show that œà is a topological embedding.
Let W‚äÜ‚Ñù n+1 be the open subset where the last coordinate is non-zero.
Then p i ‚àí1(W) is open in ‚Ñù (‚àû).
We define a map W‚Üí‚Ñù n by (x,t)‚Ü¶t ‚àí1x.
Now suppose that V‚äÜM is an arbitrary open subset.
Hence œà is an embedding.
The case for an arbitrary V is a simple adaptation of the above.
To ensure that it is an embedding, we need suitable projections V‚Üí‚Ñù n+1.
Pick a non-zero vector v 1‚ààV.
Now choose a non-zero v 2‚ààkerf 1.
Let M be a smooth manifold.
The assumption on the functionals is there to show that x‚â†0.
Let us show why this is the case.
For a finite set F‚äÜ‚Ñï, let f F=‚àë j‚ààFf j.
Now for each y‚ààM, there is some finite F‚äÜN for which ‚àëf j(y)=1.
Let us pass to that subnet.
It therefore has a convergent subnet with limit, say x‚Ä≤.
Hence œà(M) is closed in V.
For ‚Ñì 2 we can take weighted projections, say f j=1jp j.
In this case, our dual vectors will be {je j}.
For ‚Ñì ‚àû we can take weighted projections corresponding to a sequence in ‚Ñì 1.
In, say, ‚Ñì 2 then this sequence converges to 0.
Essentially, œà(x n) gets more and more diffuse.
It follows from the existence of a split map.
Let V be a locally convex topological vector space which admits a split map.
Then the space of embeddings, Emb(M,V), is contractible.
Another collaborator in parts of that work has been Michel Vaqui√©.
Such a situation is expressed by a short exact Milnor sequence (below).
The category Ab (‚Ñï,‚â•) of towers of abelian groups has enough injectives.
Now observe that each injective J ‚Ä¢ q is a tower of epimorphism.
Hence the plain limit over this diagram represents the homotopy limit.
Chopping that off by forming kernel and cokernel yields the claim for positive q.
For q=0 it follows by inspection.
The de Rham differential œâ‚âîdŒ∏ is a symplectic form.
Hence every cotangent bundle is canonically a symplectic manifold.
This type of proof may be adapted for use in undergraduate classrooms.
Our proof should help circumvent that impression.
Now put V‚âî‚ãÇ i=1 nW i.
The ‚Äúif‚Äù half is not quite so routine.
Let K‚äÜY√óX be the topological closure of the set Œî={(x,x):x‚àà|X|}.
By hypothesis, œÄ(K) is closed in Y, and contains X.
It follows that K contains a point of the form (‚àû,x).
In other words, C i‚à©U is inhabited.
I don‚Äôt know who first invented it though.
There are actually quite a few proofs of Proposition that appear in the literature.
One readily checks that K is closed.
Thus œÄ(K)‚äÜY is closed by hypothesis.
This characterization doesn‚Äôt require any form of Choice.
(This argument was also reprised here.)
We do this by induction on Œ∫.
The case Œ∫=0 is trivial.
It will be convenient to introduce some notation.
Let K‚äÜX Œ∫ be closed, and put K Œ≤‚âîCl(œÄ Œ≤ Œ∫(K)).
we are now trying to extend this up to Œ∫.
The full answer to this question is of great importance for theoretical physics.

Types tell you what kinds of global points you can add.
Let M be a model (in Set) of a first-order theory.

Saturated models always exist (maybe modulo some large cardinal assumptions.)
Inside a monster ùïÑ things often get more explicitly geometric.
This paves the way for model-theoretic Galois theory.
Types generalize points by replacing them with their principal ultrafilters of definable sets.

Finally, one may expand the model M a larger model M‚Ä≤.
This point of view is used especially for the generalization, so called Galois types.
We start with some definitions:
T locally omits Œ£ if and only if T does not locally realize Œ£.
The omitting types theorem is a converse for any consistent theory in a countable language:
This generalises the identity-assigning function of a small category C.
With this notation, the pullback of differential forms along this embedding is notationally implicit.

It plays an essential role in the construction of the Thomason model structure.
Its definition is inspired by neighborhood deformation retracts.
The composite cSd 2 carries injective simplicial maps to Dwyer maps.
This is Thomason, Proposition 4.2.
So among the Dwyer maps are all cofibrations in the Thomason model structure.

In particular, K/B is equivalent to the hom-2-category Span(K)(B,1).

It is easy to show that a composite of fibrations is a fibration.
The problem is how to construct it.
The theory for handling such a problem is categorical algebra.
We want to lift the concepts of ring and module from abelian groups to spectra.
This requires a general idea of what it means to generalize these concepts at all.
The abstract theory of such generalizations is that of monoid in a monoidal category.
These examples are all fairly immediate.
Let (ùíû,‚äó,1) be a monoidal category, def. .
This is naturally a (pointed) topologically enriched category itself.
The action property holds due to lemma .
These monoids are equivalently differential graded algebras.
The A-modules of this form are called free modules.
This natural bijection between f and fÀú establishes the adjunction.
For that let q:A‚ÜíQ be any other morphism with q‚àòŒº=f.
The commutativity of this diagram says that q=œï.
Let G be a topological group.
In this form the statement is also known as Yoneda reduction.
is formally dual to the proof of the next prop. .
This shows the claim at the level of the underlying sets.
Regard this as a pointed topologically enriched category in the unique way.
The operation of addition of natural numbers ‚äó=+ makes this a monoidal category.
This will be key for understanding monoids and modules with respect to Day convolution.
This perspective is highlighted in (MMSS 00, p. 60).
This is the form in which the structure of ring spectra usually appears in examples.
We write FMod for the resulting category of modules over the monoidal functor F.
Now we may finally state the main proposition on functors with smash product:
This is stated in some form in (Day 70, example 3.2.2).
It is highlighted again in (MMSS 00, prop. 22.1).
(We had previewed this in Part P, this example).
The braiding is, necessarily, the identity.
Here S V denotes the one-point compactification of V.
But seq is not braided monoidal.
The first statement is clear from inspection.
This we call the symmetric monoidal smash product of spectra.
We now define symmetric spectra and orthogonal spectra and their symmetric monoidal smash product.
We write OrthSpec(Top cg) for the resulting category of orthogonal spectra.
Definitions and are indeed equivalent to def. :
We discuss this for symmetric spectra.
The proof for orthogonal spectra is of the same form.
Hence the statement follows by induction.
Other structural set theories should contain an axiom similar to Lawvere's axiom of products.
Instead, one may construct ordered pairs out of some more basic operation.
Equality of proofs of a proposition is represented by a proposition.
This in other dependent type theories is called a identity type or a path type.
The above rules makes the dependent type theory into a model of intuitionistic propositional logic.
If the propositional logic is classical, then the categorical semantics is a Boolean algebra.
This was originally realized by Ross Street.
We sketch a characterization of cofibrations in VCat, where V is any B√©nabou cosmos.
Let A‚ÜífB‚ÜêgC be a cospan and let D=(A√óI)+ AB+ C(C√óI).
We claim that D has the following description.
A and B and C are (disjoint) full subcategories of D.
We write A‚ÜíiD‚ÜêjC for the inclusions.
Now suppose that B is a coalgebra for the 2-comonad in question.
Therefore, f and g are fully faithful inclusions with disjoint images.
Such a thing is sometimes called a gamut from A to C.
Binary composition is subtler.
However, B+ CD will not be codiscrete even if B and D are.
This suggests the following definition.
Co-conservative morphisms are also called liberal.
But orthogonality with respect to all such morphisms is precisely representable fully-faithfulness.
Maps out of a cocomma object are in canonical correspondence with 2-cells in K.
, then A‚ÜíF‚ÜêB is a codiscrete cofibration.
Since ‚Ñ∞-morphisms are cofaithful and liberal, A‚ÜíF‚ÜêB is certainly codiscrete.
That it is a cofibration is proven as in (MB, 4.18).
This is essentially (MB, 4.20).
This implies, of course, that ‚Ñ∞ contains the codiscrete cofibrations.
However, it is not equippable, even when V=Set.
This is essentially (MB, 3.4).
For proof see here at equivariant Hopf degree theorem.
Hence the only multiplicity that appears in Prop. is |W G(1)|=|G|.

Notice that in general a topological localization is not a hypercomplete (‚àû,1)-topos.

Let R be a preorder, and let P be an ideal in R.

For instance, suppose x‚â§y and we have a‚ãÖy‚â§b.
We then have y‚â§a/b, and hence x‚â§a/b, i.e. a‚ãÖx‚â§b.
Now take b=a‚ãÖy.
We have thus that a‚ãÖx‚â§a‚ãÖy, as required.
Likewise ‚àí/a acts like a right exponential object functor.

This is the monadic formulation of descent theory, ‚Äúmonadic descent‚Äù.
The main theorem is Beck‚Äôs monadicity theorem.
Then effective descent morphisms for the codomain fibration are precisely the regular epimorphisms.
(Use conservative pullback along epimorphisms in the monadicity theorem.)
One of the most basic examples of bifibrations are codomain fibrations cod:[I,C]‚ÜíC.
Accordingly, monadic descent applied to codomain fibrations archetypically exhibits the nature of monadic descent.
We therefore spell out this example is some detail.
Therefore monadic descent with respect to codomain fibrations encodes descent of bundles.
Hence the shape of the fibers may change drastically as we push bundles forward.
Its fiber over an object X‚ààC is the overcategory C/X.
In components this is an object P equipped with a morphism œÅ P:TP‚ÜíP.
This pullback along a composite of morphisms may be computed as two consecutive pullbacks.
So it is a transition function.
In the above section we considered monadic descent of bundles P‚ÜíY along morphisms f:Y‚ÜíX.
Let C be a category with pullbacks and let G be an internal group in C.
Let œÄ:P‚ÜíX be the coequalizer of ŒΩ and p.
We do not assume P to be trivial.
The two diagrams above are truncations of augmented simplicial objects in C.
We want to relate these objects to monads.
This rule extends to an isomorphism of monads T‚âÉTÀú.
This matches one of the definitions for an equivariant sheaf.
This models, dually, an algebraic version of vector bundles over affine schemes.
See there for details and geometric interpretations.
Another example is in gluing categories from localizations.
All the ingredients of monadic descent generalize from category theory to higher category theory.
For more on this see higher monadic descent.
The same process was apparent in the development of the classification theorem for surfaces.

consequently the preceding properties continue to hold when the adjective ‚Äòmeasurable‚Äô is removed.
There is no notion of null or full subsets of such a space.
Another variation, used especially in constructive mathematics, is a Cheng measurable space.
A set is measurable iff it appears as one component of a complemented pair.
These are actually equivalent concepts.
This is actually better behaved than it may at first seem.
This fact depends on the smoothness and fails for topological manifolds.
Conversely, is paracompactness necessary to keep the covers manageable?)

There appears a notorious ‚Äúsign problem‚Äù at finite density.
One of the long-standing problems in QCD is to reproduce profound nuclear physics.
How does this emergence take place exactly?

Each represents one of the toughest challenges in mathematics.
Confinement and EHM are inextricably linked.
Electroweak theory and phenomena are essentially perturbative; hence, possess little of this complexity.
Science has never before encountered an interaction such as that at work in QCD.
The confinement of quarks is one of the enduring mysteries of modern physics.
[ non-perturbatively, that is ]
Perhaps the most important example is four-dimensional SU(3)-lattice gauge theory.
All such questions remain open.
The second big open question is the problem of quark confinement.
Quarks are the constituents of various elementary particles, such as protons and neutrons.
It is an enduring mystery why quarks are never observed freely in nature.
This includes quark confinement, mass generation, and chiral symmetry breaking.
But we are lucky to have a tractable and fundamental problem to solve while waiting.
Hadrons are composed of quarks and are thus not fundamental particles of the Standard Model.
However, their properties follow from yet unsolved mysteries of the strong interaction.
The quark confinement conjecture is experimentally well tested, but mathematically still unproven.
And it is still unknown which combinations of quarks may or may not form hadrons.
Experimental guidance is needed to help improving theoretical models.

So a tangent vector in this context is literally an infinitesimal path in X.

The intrinsic cohomology of an √©tale (‚àû,1)-topos is √©tale cohomology.
One way to motivate this is to consider structure sheaves of flat differential forms.

Analytification is the process of universally turning an algebraic space into an analytic space.
This set X(‚ÑÇ) canonically carries the complex analytic topology.
As such it is a topological space written X an.
Equipped with the canonical structure sheaf ùí™ X an this is a complex analytic space.
This (X an,ùí™ X an) is called the analytification of X.
The analytification of an elliptic curve is the complex torus.
Moreover, under suitable conditions analytification is a fully faithful functor.

Contents see also at Galois group Idea
Classical Galois theory classifies field extensions.
There is an analogue of the Galois correspondence in this setting, see Mathew 14.
This means that we have K‚âÉL Gal(L/K).
Let K¬Ø be a fixed algebraic closure of K.
We call f‚ààK[X]‚àí{0} separable if it has no multiple zero in K¬Ø.
A subextension L‚äÇK¬Ø is called separable over K if each Œ±‚ààL is separable over K.
We henceforth consider Gal(L/K) as a profinite group in this way.
Let K‚äÇL be a Galois extension of fields with Galois group G.
Then the intermediate fields of K‚äÇL correspond bijectively to the closed subgroups of G.
This appears for instance as Lenstra, theorem 2.3.
This naturally raises the question of what corresponds to non-transitive G-sets.
If N has a basis it is called free (over A).
In this case, N is a finitely generated free module.
Recall the notion of separable elements
The separable closure K S of K is defined by K S‚âÉ{x‚ààK¬Ø|xisseparableoverK}.
From xyz it follows that the inclusion K‚äÇK S is Galois.
Then there is an equivalence of categories SAlg K op‚âÉœÄ 1(SpecK)Set.
This defines the category FEt X of finite √©tale covers of X.
This appears for instance as Lenstra, main theorem 1.11.
It is fully discussed in SGA1.
Different choices of fibre functor produce isomorphic groups.
This is important in attacks on Grothendieck's section conjecture.
In this case theorem is a reformulation of classical Galois theory.
This is a special case of the main theorem , with X=SpecK.
The theory is more fully described in the entry on Grothendieck's Galois theory.
One notices that classical Galois theory has an equivalent reformulation in topos theory.
For K a field let Et(K) be its small √©tale site.
Then Galois extensions of K correspond precisely to the locally constant objects in ‚Ñ∞.
The full subcategory on them is the Galois topos Gal(‚Ñ∞)‚Ü™‚Ñ∞.
The Galois group is the fundamental group of the topos.
Accordingly in topos theory Galois theory is generally about the classification of locally constant sheaves.
The Galois group corresponds to the fundamental group of the topos .
This will (one day be) discussed at Long March.
Grothendieck calls varieties which are completely determined by their √©tale fundamental group, anabelian varieties.
His anabelian dream was to classify the anabelian varieties in all dimensions over all fields.
This can be seen to relate to questions of the √©tale homotopy types of varieties.
(Not that I can shed much light on progress in dimension one.)
Perhaps there is an anabelian version of the homotopy hypothesis or something of that nature.
Some of the material above is taken from this.
In this case r is called a retraction of B onto A. id:A‚ÜísectioniB‚ÜíretractionrA.
Here i may also be called a section of r.
Hence a retraction of a morphism i:A‚ÜíB is a left-inverse.
The entire situation is said to be a splitting of the idempotent B‚ü∂rA‚ü∂iB.
Dually, a split monomorphism is the strongest of various notions of monomorphism.
Then a retract of a representable functor F=PSh(C) is itself representable.
In arrow categories Let Œî[1]={0‚Üí1} be the interval category.
In particular the defining classes of a model category are closed under retracts.
This is fairly immediate, a proof is made explicit here.
Finally, write [J ‚óÉ,C] for the functor category.
We give a direct and a more abstract argument.
Postcomposition with F 2‚ÜíF 1 makes this a morphism of cones G‚ÜíF 1.

Since proper maps are closed, all compact spaces are covert.
If excluded middle holds, then every locale is covert.
Constructively, covertness is already interesting when X is a set with the discrete topology.

Covert sets also satisfy the following property.
Thus, every covert set is omniscient?.

A morphism between (‚àû,1)-toposes is an (‚àû,1)-geometric morphism.
The (‚àû,1)-category of all (‚àû,1)-topos is (‚àû,1)Toposes.

The second definition includes the first as a special case.
Surjective topological submersions form a singleton Grothendieck pretopology on Top.
This is because an idempotent monad is called a reflector (A1.1.1), there.
These are often called elementary Lie groups.
We obtain a functor ùíÆ(‚àí):AbLie op‚ÜíTVS.
These are the hemi-n-spheres.
T(n) is then the set of n-ary operations.

Algebraic monad is just a monoid in the category of algebraic endofunctors.
Also there is some parallel with terminology cartesian monad.

But one should be aware of them, and of sometimes unique material exposed there.
A Heyting field with decidable equality is a discrete field.
The following proof is due to Mark Saving: Definition
Let p be a proposition.
Suppose x does not have a multiplicative inverse.
Then we see that x ‚àí1 is not in R p.
If p held, we would have x‚àí1‚ààR p.
So we know ¬¨p holds.
But this is a contradiction.
Therefore, x must be zero (using decidable equality).
Conversely, suppose R p is a Johnstone residue field.
Suppose R p is a Heyting field.
In either case, we see that p holds.
And if R p is a discrete field, it is clearly a Heyting field.
So we have full excluded middle.
This article is about a classical set theory axiom.
Some literature instead uses this name for an unrelated weakening of AC.
For that notion, see axiom of multiple choice.
Such an f is called a choice function for S.
However, it is strictly weaker in ZFA and other similar set theories.
This entry is about smooth morphisms of schemes.
Smooth morphism is a relativization of the notion of a smooth scheme.

We may also think of it as the Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle .
One calls these homotopy fibers therefore differential string structures.
In this section here we review this explicit cocycle construction.
In the next section we discuss a systematic way to derive this construction.
(This can be done because œÄ 1(G)=*.)
(This can be done because œÄ 2(G)=0.)
This implies that c(g) is indeed a Cech cocycle.
This we shall try to answer the section below.

Under construction: Extracted from a series of tweets by Syzygay Idea
Let R be a (commutative unital) ring.
Suppose I is a flat idempotent R-ideal.
To be a flat ideal means ‚àí‚äóI is an exact functor.
The tensor product is always right exact, so in particular, ‚àí‚äóI preserves injections.
We take the full subcategory of R-modules spanned by M so that I‚äóM‚â°M.
(This is not the actual definition, but this is an equivalent category.
j* does legitimately map into alModR.
To prove this, we must show that I‚äójM‚âÖjM. I‚äójM = I‚äó(I‚äóM).
An R-module M is (I-)almost 0 if IM = 0.
The only defect to being 0 is killed by the identity-like ideal.
Let f : M ‚Üí N be an R-linear map.
f is almost injective if ker f is almost 0.
f is almost surjective if coker f is almost 0.
f is an almost isomorphism if ker f and coker f are almost 0.
So we do also get a form of ‚Äúalmost‚Äù hom-tensor adjunction.
What are examples of rings R with flat idempotent ideals I?
One application is proving the tilting equivalence of perfectoid algebras.
Hence, we can reduce some problems in mixed char to char p.
The category of I-almost 0 modules is a Serre subcategory of Mod R.
These pure sets are the von Neumann ordinals.
One can construct this as a quotient set of that collection.
The class of ordinals is itself well-ordered.
There are many equivalent ways to define this ordering.
With the von Neumann definition, this is equivalent to simply saying that Œ±‚ààŒ≤.
A limit ordinal is any ordinal which is not a successor of any other ordinal.

Every local quotient stack admits a locally universal Hilbert bundle?.
Hence local quotient groupoids have a good topological K-theory.

We state the definition below in Def. .
First we need the following preliminaries:
In the context of differential geometry over D, such functions are sometimes called paraholomorphic.
An irrational number is of course a number that is not rational.
As such, the concept is perhaps uninteresting.
We may define an irrational complex number similarly.
We may give ùïÅ a topology as a subspace of the real line ‚Ñù.
In any case, they only used such numbers.
The homeomorphism is given by continued fractions (see below).
This is a Cauchy sequence whose limit is irrational.
Furthermore, every irrational number has a unique representation in this way.
The usual proofs of these theorems are entirely constructive.
We can unravel this as follows, using more traditional notation.
Let LX denote the spectrification being constructed.
This makes ‚Ñì into a map of prespectra.
Causal index sets are needed to define the notion of a causal net of algebras.
(iv) for every a‚ààI there is a b‚ààI with a‚ä•b
A poset with such a relation is called a causal index set.
One example is explained in the Idea section.
Set M‚ä•N iff M‚à©N=‚àÖ, then this defines a causal disjointness relation.
This is an example of a causal complement.

This is particularly true for software systems.
Computer algebra systems provide algorithms for symbolic computation.
Computer theorem proving systems provide tools for creating formal proofs.
There are no MMSs today that provide highly integrated symbolic computation and formal deduction capabilities.
One cannot add fundamental capabilities as an afterthought.
Thus orbispaces are to topological spaces roughly what orbifolds are to manifolds.
Write Orb for the global orbit category.
Then its (‚àû,1)-presheaf (‚àû,1)-category PSh ‚àû(Orb) is the (‚àû,1)-category of orbispaces.
Hence cellular topological stacks are equivalently the objects of equivariant homotopy theory.
(apparently the term is first used here?)
This can be expressed in terms of the bicategory Span in several ways.
Let C be a category of fibrant objects with interval object I.
By the universal property of the limit, it represents the collection of these transformations.
The dual notion is that of co-span co-trace.
See orthogonal group for a table of the relevant homotopy groups.
Another difference is that transport generally behaves better with cubical path types.
Ordinary differential cohomology classifies circle n-bundles with connection.
In low degree these are ordinary circle bundles with connection.
This happens to land in closed differential forms with integral periods (see below).

Many exactness properties can be phrased in terms of certain colimits being van Kampen.
Let C be a category with pullbacks.
Its Grothendieck construction is the codomain fibration.
Let G:D‚ÜíC be a diagram with colimit x.
Suppose C has all colimits of D-shaped diagrams.
F‚Ä≤ is a colimiting cocone.
We denote this category by ([D,C]‚áìG).
Now this functor has a left adjoint given by taking colimits.
Thus, it is an isomorphism just when (1)‚áí(2).
The condition (2)‚áí(1) is a form of descent.
Examples A category with pullbacks is lextensive just when coproducts are van Kampen.
A category with pullbacks is adhesive just when pushouts of monomorphisms are van Kampen.
In the latter case, van Kampen colimits exactly characterize descent.
It was introduced by Kleene to formalize Brouwer‚Äòs notion of choice sequence.
To define Kleene‚Äôs second algebra, we need several ingredients:
Composition of functions ‚Ñï‚Üí‚Ñï defines a map comp:B√óB‚ÜíB.
Let i:‚Ñï‚Üí1+‚Ñï be the inclusion map.
If œà denotes the given lepton spinor field, this is J Œº‚âîœà¬Ø‚ãÖŒ≥ Œº‚ãÖœà.
Is that only because of the non-canonicity of pullbacks in Set?
We omit the word ‚Äúvalue‚Äù when it is clear from context.
(However, we do not require the sets of specified values to match.)
(In general the converses may fail.)
The same results hold with source replaced by target.
There are also conditions defining equivalence relations on ùíû 0 and ùíû 1.
(The equivalence relation for ùíû 2 is simply equality.)
We say that g is an inverse of f.
This is the chosen equivalence relation for ùíû 1.
Then it is an identity 2-cell on any value of x‚àòy.
Equivalently: the 1-composition of isomorphisms is an isomorphism.
Let f, g, and h be 2-cells.
Let f, g, and h be 2-cells.
It follows that composition of 1-cells is also associative, up to isomorphism.
(It follows from the preceding relations that these compositions exist.)
This will satisfy the coherence relations because the original bicategory satisfied the bicategory coherence relations.
Every von Neumann algebra may be written as a direct integral? over factors.
This object is known as the noncommutative flow of weights?.
If the action of R is not periodic, then the factor has type III0.
See also at planar algebra.
Types typically constrain both behavior and implementation.
This is the sense in which program verification is more flexible than syntactic typing.
This doesn‚Äôt provide any additional flexibility for terms themselves, though.
From a naive perspective, it can‚Äôt be done.
The answer, for Nuprl‚Äôs proof system, is supposedly ‚Äúno‚Äù.
The terms that the CLF type system is about are called ‚Äúrealizers‚Äù.
(Since its Nuprl-inspired PER semantics is a term realizability model.)
The proof terms would be an additional class of terms.
Proof checking in CLF means type checking the proof terms.
In general, proof terms have additional information not present in realizers.
CLF types only depend on realizers, never proof terms.
CLF will boldly attempt to automate beta conversion by comparing normal forms nonetheless.
Tactics fail when they attempt to use an invalid rule instance.
The proof is complete when all goals are reduced to nothing.
A proof term can be thought of as a restricted form of proof script.
The primitive proof term formers correspond to primitive derivation rules.
Open proof term schemas correspond to derived rules.
Operations on closed proof terms correspond to admissible rules.
Instead, most of the detail work of proof checking deals with realizers.
This bootstrapping will rely in crucial ways on the realizers being fundamentally untyped.
The reason goes back to the flexibility of specifications, compared to purely syntactic typing.
The main syntactic class is terms.
There are also variables and contexts.
Complain if you can‚Äôt tell them apart from metavariables.)
The only beta reduction is (Œªx.b)a‚ü∂ Œ≤b[a/x].
Conversion is the congruence closure.
The other judgment forms will be defined inductively by the rules below.
Note that in Nuprl, the (Œì‚ä¢t‚ä©T) form is written (Œì‚ä¢T‚åäextt‚åã).
That is (important) future work.
Note the contrast with variables, which are intrinsically typed.
With (t‚ä©T), we think of t as resulting from the proof of T.
So thinking of types as PERs, subtypes are subrelations.
Every type respects itself, and Comp.
We use a ‚Äúsubsumptive‚Äù rewrite rule as equality elimination.
The terminology comes from ‚Äúsubsumptive‚Äù vs ‚Äúcoercive‚Äù implementations of subtyping.
Note that formally, CLF has no typed judgmental equality.
This is sound due to equality reflection.
An intersection element is already an element of all instances of the family.
The subset type resembles an existential quantifier.
But it‚Äôs also sound to just stick in a free variable side condition.
Our elimination rule is intuitively characterizing Bool as the least type containing tru and fls.
The usual elimination rule is derived; it‚Äôs derivable because Church booleans actually work.
The structural rules of weakening and substitution are admissible.
‚ÄúStrengthening‚Äù is not.
This is typical of extensional type theory.
Computational irrelevance is implemented by literally omitting the irrelevant proofs from terms.
This leads to the lack of strengthening, and to undecidable type checking.
The restriction imposed by equality reflection is that equality proofs never have computational content.
Once proof terms are added to the formal judgments, you probably do get strengthening.
You‚Äôd think a statement should make sense before you try to prove it.
That‚Äôs a ‚Äúsanity check‚Äù admissible rule.
It‚Äôs probably admissible for the judgments defined by the rules above.
These are ‚Äúinversion‚Äù admissible rules.
The above rules are actually admissible rules relative to those basic rules.
What are the mathematical models of Nuprl-style systems?
If they‚Äôre considered unnatural, should Nuprl-style systems be modified?
Equality uses respect which uses equality
The equality formation rule refers to the respect (‚Äú‚â∫‚Äù) relation.
The latter is not primitive, it‚Äôs defined in terms of equality.
The rule about respecting Comp just exposes the fact internally.
Equality types beyond that are for reasoning about membership.
Taking function extensionality to be Œ† intro seems odd.
That‚Äôs (one place) where the selectivity rules are handy.
Lambdas are functions, not by fiat, but because they produce results when applied.
Note that not all functions are denoted by lambdas.
At the very least, the empty function is denoted by any term you like.
That is, a function type with empty domain has the same PER as ‚ä§.
That may turn out to handle everything, with this judgmental setup.
This provides a form of syntactic reflection of a system‚Äôs judgments within itself.
There are ways of making syntactic reflection more convenient and/or powerful.
(But the type family is called ‚Äúequality‚Äù.)
The difference is in the interpretation of the equality judgment.
There are two styles of interpretation for ETT: intrinsic and extrinsic.
Intrinsic seems to have become the default one.
It‚Äôs the style considered in Martin Hofmann‚Äôs thesis, for example.
But Nuprl and CLF commit to the extrinsic style.
The role of the Nuprl-style type system is to reason about that.
There is actually no interpretation necessary, for terms in general.
(A denotational semantics would probably work too.)
The details need not concern us here, but some things are important:
Some closed terms are designated as types, and denote PERs on closed terms.
So being an element must be somehow prior to equality.
(And actually, it may be that types need not be computations.)
No, that doesn‚Äôt work.
The extra complexity has to do with making the axiomatization work for open terms.
Consider the type I‚âî{x=y|x‚ààBool‚àßy‚ààBool}.
But then consider (x:I‚ä¢tru=x‚ààBooltype).
For example, ‚â∫, ‚äÜ, <:, and ‚äë were defined above.
But what kinds of things are these semantic judgments in general?
Extensionally equal types denote the same PER.
Also: (A‚âàB)‚âà(A‚äëB‚àßB‚äëA) However, (A‚äÜB‚àßB‚äÜA) is generally weaker.
Let ¬¨A‚âîA‚Üí‚ä• decA‚âî{b:Bool|((b=tru‚ààBool)‚ÜíA)‚àß((b=fls‚ààBool)‚Üí¬¨A)}
By non-contradiction, decA is a subsingleton, so ‚åàdecA‚åâ‚âàdecA.
There generally aren‚Äôt implications going in the other direction.
(None of this has to do with intuitionism.)
It should be consistent to add the rule: Œì‚ä¢AtypeŒì‚ä¢p‚ä©(¬¨¬¨A)‚Üí‚åäA‚åã
This makes the semantic judgments classical, rather than intuitionistic.
Constructive propositions remain constructive, and canonicity is not affected.
Specifically, B only needs to be a type if A is inhabited.
(Because that‚Äôs the only case in which it‚Äôs evaluated.)
B only needs to be a type if a is fls.
The usual elimination rule then just applies b at that function type.
Subtyping Subtyping variance rules should be derivable for the type constructors.
What does all this extra complexity buy us?
But the terms are still written as realizers, no matter the type.
Combining with respect, we get (T<:{x=y:T|R}).
I is a singleton, but Bool is not.
The effect on equality is a consequence of set extensionality.
In programming, programmers informally use quotients, probably mostly without realizing it.
Any meaningful results given to the user should not depend on this information.
Logical frameworks provide a formal notation for languages.
(That includes the degenerate case of languages with no binding forms.
(See the logical framework page.)
That‚Äôs the catch.)
Unlike LF, MLLF doesn‚Äôt have a fixed judgmental equality.
MLLF is particularly well suited to specifying variants of Martin-L√∂f type theory.
There are tools that provide a style of language specification very similar to MLLF.
That is, it‚Äôs something that you can sanely just check automatically.
(Or so the story goes.)
(Either the system will give up, or do something useless.)
The equality reflection rule is enough to make the judgments synthetic.
That is, something you generally have to prove.
Like LF, and unlike MLLF, LF= has a fixed judgmental equality.
LF= is LF plus a reflective equality type constructor.
This means you don‚Äôt need to encode congruence rules.
(The adequacy of reflective equality is inspired by Andromeda.)
natrec should be the dependent elimination form for the inductive type of natural numbers.
We will write (plus n m) as (n + m).
Note that there‚Äôs no trouble declaring this constant.
It‚Äôs just another judgmental equality rule for the object language.
LF= was prepared all along for equality requiring proof.
That type checking really is just automatic ‚Äúproving‚Äù of judgments.
Declared LF type families correspond to CLF inductive type family definitions.
LF signatures are not ordinary inductive-inductive families.
HOAS should be used in CLF too.
Instead, lambdas from Comp can be used as the representation of binding subexpressions.
(It should include at least all LF= signatures.
With sufficient proof automation, reasoning about derivability allows the convenient use of object languages.
The declarations concluding with an equality type correspond to equality constructors.

More in detail this means the following.
But it is Quillen equivalent to a model structure that is left proper.
every model category in which each object is fibrant is right proper.
This includes for instance the standard Quillen model structure on topological spaces.
Model categories which are both left and right proper include
In this all objects are fibrant, so that it is right proper.
This is the content of (Rezk 02) Properties General
A model category in which all objects are fibrant is right proper.
See in the list of Examples below for concrete examples.
This can be found, for instance, as Lemma 9.4 of Bousfield 2001.
Suppose given X‚ÜíY‚ÜêZ where X‚ÜíY is a fibration and Z‚ÜíY a weak equivalence.
Thus, the induced map X√ó YZ‚ÜíRX√ó RYZ is a weak equivalence.
We follow the proof given in this latter reference.
We demonstrate the first statement, the second is its direct formal dual.
The weak equivalence L‚Ä≥‚Üí‚âÉL is by the 2-out-of-3 property.
This establishes in particular a weak equivalence X‚Ä≤‚Üí‚âÉL‚Ä≥‚àê KY.
It remains to get a weak equivalence further to X.
Therefore by the pasting law, also the lower square is a pushout.
Factor this morphism as A‚Ü™C‚Ä≤‚Üí‚âÉC by a cofibration followed by an acyclic fibration.
The proof for the second statement is the precise formal dual.
In general, the converse can be proven only if A and B are fibrant.
The following are equivalent: M is right proper.
This is due to Rezk 02, Prop. 2.5.

Beware that an old word for monad is also ‚Äútriple‚Äù.
Arrows are composed by plugging outputs into inputs, as when one composes unary operations.
Categories are monads in the bicategory of ordinary spans (of sets).
We will start from the former and gradually generalize to the latter.
Are ordinary symmetric multicategories the T-multicategories relative to any monad T?
(Also, that monad is not cartesian.)
This reduces to the natural notion of functor in all the examples mentioned above.
It does, however, yield a virtual double category.
Obtaining the relevant monads
Each of the above contexts for generalized multicategories requires a monad of a certain sort.
This generalises in topos theory to the notion of decidable object.
Right localizations are defined analogously and generalize coreflective localizations.
Let C be a model category with a class of morphisms S.
So we can ‚Äútest isomorphism by homming them into objects‚Äù.
More generally, recall the following facts about reflective localizations.
The following definitions offer a completely analogous picture for model categories.
This is described in detail at enriched homs from cofibrants to fibrants.
Lemma Every ordinary weak equivalence is also S-local weak equivalence.
Right Bousfield localizations are defined analogously and generalize coreflective localizations.
In practice, left localizations are always constructed as left Bousfield localizations.
Therefore, both notions are used interchangeably.
Then it has the following properties.
Therefore fÀú:Q f‚ÜíB‚ãÖŒî n is indeed a cofibration.
The coproduct of two cofibrant objects is cofibrant because cofibrations are preserved under pushout.
Therefore Q f is indeed a cofibrant domain of our cofibration.
The argument proceeds along the same lines as the proof of the above lemma.
Let X‚ààùíü be any object.
First consider a cofibrant replacement X cof ‚Üì ‚ààW‚à©Fib X.
Then apply L to this L(X cof) ‚Üì L(X).
Finally, precompose with the ordinary adjunction unit.
S-local weak equivalences between S-local objects are weak equivalences
By the Yoneda lemma this implies that f is an isomorphism in Ho S(C).
But that means precisely that it is a weak equivalence in C.
It follows that also the fibrations between local objects remain the same:
From remark we already know that Fib loc‚äÇFib, generally.
It follows that A^,B^‚ààFib loc.
This means that we have lifting in the top right square.
Moreover, we also evidently have lifting in the bottom left square.
Together, these lifts constitute the desired total lift.
Every Bousfield localization is of this form
First, the cofibrations of C loc and L SC coincide.
This is due to Hirschhorn (2002).
Proof The first part is theorem 3.3.19 in Hirschhorn (2002).
The second part is prop 3.3.4, which follows directly from the following proposition.
The details are spelled out in the following subsections.
For Œª>Œ∫ every Œ∫-compact object is also Œª-compact.

Contents Idea A combinatorial model category is a particularly tractable model category structure.
So as a slogan we have that
See the list of examples below.
For more see at locally presentable categories - introduction.
In addition, every combinatorial model category can be enhanced to an algebraic model category.
The following definition originates with Jeff Smith:
This greatly facilitates identifying combinatorial model category structures.
Moreover, every combinatorial model category arises in this way.
The above formulation follows (Barwick, prop 1.7).
Let J be the set of acyclic cofibratons P‚ÜíR so obtained.
It readily follows that inj(J)‚à©W‚äÜinj(I).
For applications of this theorem, the following auxiliary statements are useful.
This is due to Smith.
A proof appears as Dugger 01, 7.4.
The following formulation can be found as Proposition A.2.6.15 in Lurie.
Carrying this program through requires the following intermediate results.
Notice that the theorem just mentions plain combinatorial model categories, not simplicial model categories.

This are corollaries 2.7 and 2..8 in Bar.

It remains to show that the second morphism is a weak equivalence.

More generally, every Cisinski model structure is combinatorial.
Not every cofibrantly generated model category is also a combinatorial model category.
One might therefore ask which cofibrantly generated model categories are Quillen equivalent to combinatorial ones.

Two objects are equivalent if there is an equivalence between them.
This can be made rigorous as a corecursive definition.
The latter notion is generalized to weak equivalence for objects in any model category.
There is also a notion of equivalence between model categories: Quillen equivalence.
These can be understood to some extent using higher categories.
Similarly, Quillen equivalent model categories give rise to equivalent (infinity,1)-categories.
See equivalence in an (infinity,1)-category.
See equivalence in homotopy type theory.
By a prefix order we mean a partial order which is also downwards totally ordered.
A prefix ordered set is a set equipped with a prefix order.
The morphisms of prefix ordered sets are history preserving functions.
Given x‚ààS, the history of x is the set x ‚àí={y‚à£y‚â§x}.
In this way, prefix ordered sets form a category Pfx.
Prefix orders relax this definition to downward total orders.
Any partial order can be viewed as an Alexandroff topology.
Continuous maps are the homomorphisms between topological spaces.
(See also at continuous space.)
We state the definition of continuity in terms of epsilontic analysis, definition below.
The function f is called just continuous if it is continuous at every point x‚ààX.
This is called the metric topology.
First assume that f is continuous in the epsilontic sense.
Conversely, assume that f ‚àí1 takes open subsets to open subsets.
Equivalently, f is continuous iff f * is microcontinuous?.
A continuous map between locales is simply a frame homomorphism in the opposite direction.
(Technically, an open map is any function with just this property.)
(Technically, a closed map is any function with just this property.)
Various notions of continuous function are used in constructive mathematics.
The same equivalences hold in intuitionistic mathematics, thanks to the fan theorem.
But no two of these are equivalent in Russian constructivism.
The composition of kontinuous functions is kontinuous.
The function ‚Ñù +‚Üí‚Ñù,x‚Ü¶1/x is kontinuous.
Write œá(X) for its Euler characteristic.

Let a category be given which is both cartesian closed and cocartesian coclosed.

These are hence a crucial ingredient for well-adapted models of synthetic differential geometry.
This function g is also called a Hadamard quotient.
It follows that g(0)=f‚Ä≤(0) is the derivative of f at 0.
The lemma follows by putting g i(x)=‚à´ 0 1‚àÇf‚àÇx i(tx)dt.

Graded monads are also known as parametric monads.
The grading idea may also be applied to comonads.
The grading may arise from a monoid (M,‚äó,e).
In computer science, monads model effects and comonads coeffects.
Grading can therefore allow further annotation of these.
For graded monads relevant for probability theory see (Perrone).
Every lax action can be generated from a strict action in this way.
This construction reduces certain problems in measure-theoretic probability to purely combinatorial problems.

For emphasis the description of dynamics by action functionals is called the Lagrangean approach.
Let C‚ààH be the configuration space of a physical system.
The equation dexp(i‚ÑèS(‚àí))=0 is the Euler-Lagrange equation of the system.
An action functional is called local if it arises from integration of a Lagrangian.
When minimising the action, we fix the values of q(a) and q(b).
We fix boundary conditions on the boundary of R.
The formulation of (3) above is still not manifestly coordinate independent.
This is of particular interest, again, if it is local.
This is hence a fully local Lagrangian: an extended Lagrangian.
These look like solutions localized in spacetime: ‚Äúat an instant‚Äù.

This is the original notion of concrete group due to √âvariste Galois.
The Cayley theorem? shows that every group may be made into a concrete group.
Unlike groups, categories were first defined in full modern abstraction.
Of course, an abstract category is the usual notion of category.
This immediately generalises to L 2(X), where X is any measure space.
The abstract definition of a concrete set is then that given at pure set.
; these were the first sets studied, predating set theory as such.
A left adjoint to a forgetful functor is called a free functor.
Many left adjoints can be constructed as quotients of free functors.

Every equivalence relation is an reflexive symmetric relation which is also a transitive relation.
The negation of a irreflexive symmetric relation is a reflexive symmetric relation.
The double negation of every equivalence relation is an irreflexive symmetric relation.
In constructive mathematics, this is not guaranteed to be transitive.
Instead, the double negation of equality is only a stable reflexive symmetric relation.

A comment is also in
This is Part II of an exposition by Todd Trimble on ETCS.
The differences may be summarized as follows:
We say i,j define the same subset if this k is an isomorphism.
So: subsets of X are defined to be isomorphism classes of monomorphisms into X.
Hence, there are natural bijections R‚äÜB√óAA‚ÜíP(B)R‚äÜB√óAB‚ÜíP(A) between subsets and classifying maps.
[Cf. classifying spaces in the theory of fiber bundles.]
Something similar happens in ETCS set theory: Lemma 1.
The domain of elementhood ‚àà 1‚Üí1√óP(1)‚âÖP(1) is terminal.
Hence elementhood ‚àà 1‚äÜ1√óP(1) is given by an element t:1‚ÜíP(1).
In that sense, t:1‚ÜíP(1) plays the role of a universal subset.
To illustrate these ideas, let us consider intersection.
Externally, the intersection operation is a natural transformation ‚à© X:Sub(X)√óSub(X)‚ÜíSub(X).
Let‚Äôs analyze this bit by bit.
The identity element for ‚àß is the element t:1‚ÜíP(1).

Theorem 1. P(1) admits internal implication.
This applies in particular to any monomorphism e:[w]‚ÜíA that represents the subset [w]‚äÜA.
By the same token, there is a natural bijection R‚äÜ(X√óA)√óBœï‚Ä≤:X√óA‚ÜíP(B).
The map on the right of the pullback is defined similarly.
An ordinary predicate of type A is a function œï:A‚ÜíP(1).
Alternatively, it is an ordinary element œï‚Ä≤:1‚ÜíP(1) A‚âÖP(A).

Let œï:X‚ÜíP(1) A be a generalized predicate of type A.

The bicategorical nerve is the nerve induced from that.
So for C a bicategory we have N(C):[k]‚Ü¶BiCat NLax(Œî[k],C).
There are also an oplax version and two non-normalized versions.
The simplicial sets in the image of the geometric nerve are 3-coskeletal.
The nerve is a full and faithful functor BiCat NLax‚ÜísSet.
The latter is found by taking the nerve of each ‚Äòhom-category‚Äô.

The task in holographic QCD is to sort out the fine-print.
But for QCD the number of colors is small, N c=3.
QCD is a challenging theory.
After this fitting, all other infinite number of masses and coupling constants are fixed.
This version [the holographic WSS model] of the holographic QCD is extremely predictive.
This is why the picture is extremely predictive.

Incorporating bulk string corrections further improves these results, see Sonnenschein-Weissman 18.
Relations between gauge fields and strings present an old, fascinating and unanswered question.
The full answer to this question is of great importance for theoretical physics.
Moreover, in the SU(N) gauge theory the strings interaction is weak at large N.
The challenge is to build a precise theory on the string side of this duality.
This is, however, very different from the picture of strings as flux lines.
Interestingly, even now people often don‚Äôt distinguish between these approaches.
However there are cases in which t‚ÄôHooft‚Äôs mechanism is really working.
Furthermore, although there is available data, this has large errors.

This article is about smash products in topology/homotopy theory.
For the notion of Hopf smash product see at crossed product algebra.
Under stabilization this induces the important smash product of spectra in stable homotopy theory.
The smash product is the tensor product in the closed monoidal category of pointed sets.
Write *‚ààùíû for the terminal object of ùíû.
In this generality this appears as (Elmendorf-Mandell 07, construction 4.19).
A proof appears as (Elmendorf-Mandell 07, lemma 4.20).
For more of these details see at Pointed object ‚Äì Closed and monoidal structure.
For the topos ùíû= Set the general discussion here reduces to that above.
In particular, the smash product is associative for pointed compactly generated spaces.
This is briefly mentioned in Bredon 93, p. 199.
See at symmetric smash product of spectra.
While elementary in itself, this has the following profound consequence:
While the smash product is not cartesian, it does admit diagonals.
This is the equivariant and stable version of rational homotopy theory.

Let G be a finite group.
See also at motivation for cohesive toposes for a non-technical discussion.
Moreover, the idea is that cohesion makes points lump together to connected pieces .
This is modeled by one more functor Œ† 0:‚Ñ∞‚ÜíSet left adjoint to Disc.
See the examples at cohesive site for concrete illustrations of these ideas.
Either of these morphisms we call the points-to-pieces transform.
The first statement is due to (Johnstone 11, Corollary 2.2).
The first statement follows directly from Lemma .
This proves the second statement.
(pieces have points ‚âÉ discrete objects are concrete)
In one direction, assume that ptp B is an epimorphism.
In the other direction, assume that ptp H is an epimorphism.
This condition pieces have points may also be expressed as follows:
This is Lawvere-Menni 15, lemma 4.1, 4.2.
These extra axioms are proposed in (Lawvere, Axiomatic cohesion).
This implies that for all X‚àà‚Ñ∞ also f !Œ© X‚âÉ*.
This appears as axiom 2 in (Lawvere, Categories of spaces).
See there for more details.
We discuss properties of cohesive toposes.
Some of these phenomena have a natural Modality interpretation.
We record some relations between the various axioms characterizing cohesive toposes.
This is just a reformulation of the above proposition.
The last item is then a consequence by definition.
This is (Johnstone 11, theorem 3.4).
We discuss some of these.
Write Conc(‚Ñ∞)‚Ü™‚Ñ∞ for the full subcategory on concrete objects.
The claim then follows by standard facts of quasitoposes of biseparated presheaves.
Also coDisc:Set‚Üí‚Ñ∞ clearly factors through Conc(‚Ñ∞).
the components of the reflector X‚Üís !s *X are epimorphisms.
This is theorem 2 in (Lawvere).
Since Œì is a left adjoint it preserves colimits, as does of course Œ†.
It then also follows that ‚Ñí is closed under arbitrary products.
Every topos ‚Ñ∞ comes with its internal logic.
Therefore in this case Œìœï‚ÜíŒìA is an isomorphism and hence so is #œï‚Üí#A.
Simple as it is, it does serve to already illustrate some key points.
The ‚Äúcohesive pieces‚Äù are the S i and there are |I|-many of them.
This is what Œ† 0 computes, which clearly preserves products.
The canonical morphism Œì(I‚ÜêS)‚ÜíŒ† 0(I‚ÜêS) is ŒìDiscŒì(I‚ÜêS)‚ÜíŒì(I‚ÜêS)‚ÜíŒìDiscŒ† 0(I‚ÜêS).
Plugging in the above this is just S‚ÜíI itself.
Indeed, by the above interpretation, this sends each point to its cohesive component.
The formal dual of this statement is the following.
In summary we have Proposition
We spell out some details on the cohesive topos of reflexive directed graphs.
The canonical morphism ŒìX‚ÜíŒ† 0X sends each vertex to its connected component.
Evidently this is epi, hence in RDGraphs cohesive pieces have points .
Notice that reflexive directed graphs are equivalently skeleta of simplicial sets.
The former is manifestly the operation of evaluating on the terminal object.
This implies that also coDisc is fully faithful, by this prop..
Equivalently, Disc‚âÉp * is the constant diagram-assigning functor.
This establishes the first clause in Def. .
By the adjunction relation this is equivalently X(U)‚ÜíSet(Œì(U),Œì(X)).
The corresponding cohesive topos is the Cahiers topos ‚âÉSh(ThCartSp).
This is a smooth topos that models the axioms of synthetic differential geometry.
In words this says that in ùí´ every cohesive neighbourhood contains precisely one point.
This is a characteristic of infinitesimally thickened points.
See at infinitesimal cohesion for more on this.
Let G be a non-trivial finite group of cardinality n.
Write BG={‚Ä¢‚Üíg‚Ä¢|g‚ààG} for its delooping groupoid.
The presheaf topos PSh(BG)‚âÉGSet is the category of permutation representations of G.
It comes with a triple of adjoint functors (Œ† 0‚ä£Const‚ä£lim ‚Üê):GSet‚Üílim ‚Üê‚ÜêConst‚Üílim ‚ÜíSet.
Therefore Œ† 0 does not preserve products in this case.
The axioms for a cohesive topos originate around
An analysis of the interdependency of the axioms on a cohesive topos is in

This fact serves to prove the Weil conjectures.
Indeed, this action is manifestly fixed-point free.

So should we merge this with PRO now? ‚ÄîToby
Let us consider only finitary theories; that is, with Lawvere theories.
In a monoidal category, we can ask for this to be a monoidal functor.
We therefore need to weaken the definition of a Lawvere theory.
Let (C,‚äó,I) be a monoidal category.
Let (T,‚äó,I) be a monoidal Lawvere theory.
A monoidal T-object in (C,‚äó,I) is a monoidal functor T‚ÜíC.
Let us therefore give these names.
Let (C,‚äó,I) be a monoidal category.
C co is the subcategory of commutative, associative, unital comonoids.
Note that we take morphisms in C, not morphisms of comonoids.
These are the objects that come equiped with diagonal and projection morphisms.
So I could still have a commutative monoid in an arbitrary monoidal category.
Or maybe I can‚Äôt.
It‚Äôd be useful to get that clear.
I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a general switcheroo functor.
However, not every object is a coalgebra.
Okay, let me be absolutely specific here.
This is tied up with Tall-Wraith monoids.
Now start with abelian groups instead.
OK, this makes sense.
Toby: H'm, this is odd.
Okay, I still wasn‚Äôt being completely clear.
I do mean the category of coalgebras.
That‚Äôs again a ring and it‚Äôs functorial for coalgebra morphisms.
But this felt like it was a specialisation of an even more general story.
Okay, so to pick up the thread again, here is a preliminary observation.
I don‚Äôt know how well it generalizes to general props or pros.
However, there are many Lawvere theories that do not need such structure.
If an identity involves duplicating an element, it needs the diagonal structure.
If an identity involves ignoring an element, it needs the projection structure.
Now let us add in an inverse.
These involve both a duplication and an omission.
Note that the starting point for each is the ordered list (a).
Therefore a group object in a monoidal category must lie in the subcategory of comonoids.
This is the identity: CommutativityŒº(a,b)=Œº(b,a)
This obviously involves a swap, and thus requires a symmetric object as its model.
Finally, for an abelian group object we need both: symmetry and comonoid.
One of the applications of Lawvere theories is to the theory of representing objects.
Well, okay, one question springs to mind.
Are they equivalent as monoidal Lawvere theories?
I‚Äôll try to set aside some time to find a better answer.
I believe the answer is no.
I keep wanting to write ‚Äúrepetition, hesitation, or deviation‚Äù.

Of course, in classical mathematics, every set has decidable equality.

Now suppose B is an arbitrary set of real numbers.
The set B is Lebesgue measurable if |B|=|A‚à©B|+|A‚àñB| holds for every set A.
Restricting to these sets, Lebesgue outer measure becomes an honest measure.
See also Jordan content References Named after Henri Lebesgue.
Since BB typically will be large this requires GLOBAL CHOICE, i.e. choice for classes.
This principle is independent even from ZFC.
But for getting the right adjoints one has to use global choice.
The fibred right adjoints will not be split even if the original functors was split.

Thus, direct categories can be seen as a categorification of well-founded relations.
A category with this property is sometimes called a one-way category.
The notion of generalized direct category, below, relaxes this requirement.
However, a category can be inverse without having finite fan-out.
Thereby we obtain the following equivalent conditions for D to be a generalized direct category.
D contains no infinite descending chains of noninvertible morphisms ‚ãØ‚Üí‚ãÖ‚Üí‚ãÖ‚Üí‚ãÖ.

By lemma this irreducible closed subspace corresponds to a point p‚ààSX.
It remains to see that there is no other such point.
So let p 1‚â†p 2‚ààSX be two distinct points.
This means that there exists U‚ààœÑ X with p 1(U)‚â†p 2(U).
This means that (SX,œÑ SX) is T0.

Thus, every non-zero-divisor is a cancellative element.

One-sided numbers are sometimes called (upper or lower) semicontinuous numbers.
Lower and upper reals don't interact well together.
Indeed, we could take any dense set of real numbers.)
A lower real number is the supremum of an inhabited set of numbers.
An extended lower real is the supremum of an arbitrary set of numbers.
An upper real number is the infimum of an inhabited set of numbers.
An extended lower real is the infimum of an arbitrary set of numbers.
We cannot generalize further by taking more extrema of the same sort.

An upper real number is an extended upper real U such that: some b‚ààU.
A bounded upper real number is an upper real U such that some a‚àâU.

A 2-polycategory is a polycategory enriched over Cat.
It can be identified with a double polycategory with only identity vertical arrows.
That leads to the concept of a commutative invertible quasigroup.

Every abelian group is a commutative invertible monoid.
The empty quasigroup is a commutative invertible quasigroup.
We write CE(ùîì(X,œÄ)) for the exterior algebra equipped with this differential.
More explicitly, let {x i}:X‚Üí‚Ñù dimX be a coordinate patch.
This is equivalently called Poisson cohomology (see there for details).
The invariant polynomial œâ makes ùîì(X,œÄ) a symplectic ‚àû-Lie algebroid.
Under Lie integration a Poisson Lie algebroid is supposed to yield a symplectic groupoid.
There is a formulation of Legendre transformation in terms of Lie algebroid.
Richard Montague (1930-1971) was an American logician.
The concept is due to Dmitri Pavlov.
At present, there is no purely order-theoretic definition of measurable locales.
However, there are a few other ways of defining them.
First we give definitions appropriate for classical mathematics.
There are at least three equivalent ways of doing so.
Note that the measure on X is irrelevant except to specify the null subsets.
In constructive mathematics (This section is not due to Pavlov.)
Figuring this out could allow the definitions through measurable spaces or continuous valuations to work.
(But the main problem is completeness, not complements.)
Normal measures are also known as continuous valuations.
This is related to œÉ-locales?.

A category is called gaunt if all its isomorphisms are in fact identities.
See below for some related concepts that are invariant.
Every gaunt category is skeletal, but not conversely.
More generally, gaunt categories are precisely the categories that are both strict and univalent.
For in this case, every identity type is a proposition/subsingleton.
Every poset is a gaunt category.
The walking parallel pair is a gaunt category which is not a poset.
The free category on a directed graph is a gaunt category.
The walking isomorphism, as usually defined, is not gaunt.
The simplex category and more generally any Reedy category is gaunt.
The core of a gaunt category is a set.

Suppose a Lie group G acts smoothly and transitively on a smooth manifold M.
Hence E is a G-equivariant vector bundle over M.
The ‚Äòprocess‚Äô described is actually a functor, the induction functor.
The induced bundle construction gives a functor L:Rep(H)‚ÜíVect(M,G)
This functor is simpler than the induced bundle construction!
The simpler functor often amounts to ‚Äòforgetting‚Äô something.
This forgetful functor is usually the right adjoint.
And indeed, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening here!
LV is the induced bundle corresponding to V.
Because these left adjoints tend to be important.
And why is this so great?
We formulate induction and coinduction of representations abstractly in homotopy type theory.
Let H be an ambient (‚àû,1)-topos.
We discuss that unitary representations induce again unitary representations.
This shows that r is unitary.
But where do we get a G-invariant measure on G/H?
The existence of this adjunction is known as Frobenius reciprocity.
We now wish to show that L and R are adjoint functors.
This bundle has a projection œÄ 2:(G√óV)/H‚ÜíG/H, œÄ 2([(g,v)])=gH.

We introduced these linear bijections œï g when initially describing the induced bundle construction.
Suppose f *(w)=[(e,v)] for some v‚ààV.

and E is nondegenerate, i.e., 1 is not an initial object.
Here the global section functor is even (isomorphic to) the identity functor.
So the above statements are also equivalent to well-pointedness.
To see this, let U‚Ü£A be a subobject and ¬¨U its Heyting complement.
Similarly, a well-pointed topos is two-valued.
Finally, a well-pointed topos has split supports.
If it is 0 then A‚âÖ0 also and its support is split.
Thus a splits the support of A.
Conversely, we have the following: Theorem
Let A‚Ü£B be a monomorphism such that every global element of B factors through it.
Then ‚àÄ BA is a subterminal object, hence either 1 or 0.
Hence it must be that ‚àÄ BA=1, which implies A=B.
The category Set of sets and functions is both well-pointed and concrete.

A quandle is a special case of a rack.
A quandle is a selfdistributive idempotent right quasigroup.
So, this definition has a certain redundancy built in.
See rack for more discussion of related points.
Every tame knot in ‚Ñù 3 has a ‚Äúfundamental quandle‚Äù.
So, this presentation can also be used as a presentation of a quandle.
The fundamental quandle is a very powerful invariant of knots.
More sophisticated invariants of this sort can be constructed with the help of quandle cohomology.
In fact this leads to an elegant definition of symmetric spaces.
In particular it is a constructive and purely homotopy-theoretic proof.
We then move to more advanced tools.
Every (left) noetherian ring is a coherent ring.
This is probably connected to the importance of coherent sheaves.
The original category can be recovered from this category if it satisfies certain properties.
The name derives from programming terminology.
A morphism f:A‚ÜíB represents an effectful program.
Note that the condition (LŒ∏)Œ∏=(Œ∏L)Œ∏ in the definition says precisely that Œ∏ is thunkable.
This is the case for the Kleisli category of the identity monad.
On the other hand, most monads produce many non-thunkable morphisms.
Let (T,Œ∑,Œº) be a monad on a category C.
The Kleisli category of T is a thunk-force category.
Let F‚ä£G denote the adjunction between C and the Kleisli category C T.
Define L=FG and œµ the counit of the comonad.
Then there is a monad L Œ∏ induced on G Œ∏K by this adjunction.

We call an instance of this equation a class equation.

Now let Œ∂‚àà‚ÑÇ be any primitive n th root of unity.
First we show that Sylow subgroups exist.
Therefore p-Sylow subgroups P exist for any finite group G.
In particular, all Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate to one another.
In particular, Fix H(G/P) has at least one element, say gP.
Restrict the action to the subgroup P.
We conclude Fix P(Y) has exactly one element.
From |Y|‚â°|Fix P(Y)|modp (Proposition ), the theorem follows.
From Theorem , we have an p+bp k=1 for some integers a,b.
The Sylow theorems are routinely used throughout group theory.
(For example, a group of order 2023=7‚ãÖ17 2 must be commutative.)
It follows that PQ is a subgroup of order p 2q, hence PQ=G.
Noncommutative symmetric functions are a generalisation of symmetric functions.
Noncommutative symmetric functions also arise in their own right as interesting objects of study.

For T the theory of commutative rings this is called the affine line .
For the first direction, let R be a ‚Ñ§-graded commutative algebra.
Similarly the unitality of the action is the equation (1) n=1.

This is discussed in more detail at groupoid object in an (‚àû,1)-category.
There will be one additional condition on category objects (‚Äúcompleteness‚Äù).

See (Lurie, example 1.1.4).
Every groupoid object in H is canonically an internal pre-category.
The coreflection is the core operation that discards non-invertible morphisms.
This is (Lurie, prop. 1.1.14).
Write K 0‚âî{1,2}‚Ü™K for the image of the (1,2)-edge of Œî 3.
By construction, Core(X)(K)‚ÜíX(K) is fully faithful.
Hence Core(X)(K)‚ÜíX(K) is an equivalence.

In this case, every element x is a supremum of those atoms a‚â§x.
To show B is atomistic, it suffices to show c=0.
In a power set the atoms are the singleton subsets.
This is simply because a‚àßb‚â§a, so equals either a or ‚ä•.
Let a be an atom.
Thus a‚â§x i for some i, which is what we want.
Thus B(a,‚àí) does not preserve suprema.

Here is an equivalent way to phrase it that is often convenient for locale theory.
This directed open cover is useful for locales.
Taking the upper bound for a direction as unioning, clearly ùí∞‚Ä≤ is directed.
So, by hypothesis, X belongs to ùí∞‚Ä≤.
So X is a union of finitely many opens of ùí∞.
This shows X is compact according to Definition .
Beware that this is really meant as a subset, not as a tuple.
So for instance {œÉ(k),œÉ(œÉ(k)),œÉ 3(k)),‚ãØ}‚äÇ{1,‚ãØ,n} is the same cycle.

But for the present purpose we stick with the simpler special case of def. .
There is no condition on the morphisms in def. .
Next we turn to extracting information from this sequence of sequences.
For completeness we spell it out:
First consider that the morphisms are well defined in the first place.

Higher topos theory provides the formalizations of this most fundamental aspect of physics.
A general context for spaces is a big (‚àû,1)-topos H.
A general context for geometrical spaces is a local (‚àû,1)-topos.

Every cohesive (‚àû,1)-topos is in particular a locally ‚àû-connected (‚àû,1)-topos.
These are all topological quantum field theories.

Hence that F is a full functor.

Contents Idea The Bianchi identity is a differential equation satisfied by curvature data.
Generally it applies to the curvature of ‚àû-Lie algebroid valued differential forms.
For 2-form curvatures Let U be a smooth manifold.
The Bianchi identity in this case is the equation dF=0.
We may reformulate the above identities as follows.
This identifies the 1-form A‚ààŒ© 1(U,ùî§).
This is the Bianchi identity.

Fr√∂licher spaces are examples of generalised smooth spaces.
Let ‚Ñõ denote the category with one object and morphism set C ‚àû(‚Ñù,‚Ñù).
Let X=(C,F) be a generalised ‚Ñõ-object satisfying Isbell duality.
From the page about the Isbell envelope, X is concrete.
Let |X| denote the set of constant elements of C.
By concreteness, C injects into Set(‚Ñù,|X|) and F injects into Set(|X|,‚Ñù).
We shall do similarly for elements of F.
Hence it is an element of C.
That is, there is an element Œ± of C such that Œ±(œï)=|œï|‚àòŒ≤ for all œï‚ààF.
Let us compare |Œ±| with Œ≤.
But if |Œ±| and Œ≤ differ, then they differ at some t‚àà‚Ñù.
This corresponds to some œà‚ààF and it remains to compare |œà| with Œ∏.
This is simpler since x‚àà|X| is an element of C and so |œà|(x)=œà(x)=Œ∏‚àò|x|=Œ∏(x).
However, not all Fr√∂licher spaces can be obtained in this manner.
The problem here is that there are far more curves than the functionals warrant.
Put another way, the functionals cannot distinguish between the points of the set.
The object of E(‚Ñõ) corresponding to a Fr√∂licher space is F-saturated.
Let (X,C,F) be a Fr√∂licher space.
Define |œï|:X‚Üí‚Ñù by |œï|(x)=œï(Œ¥ x) where Œ¥ x‚ààC is the constant function at x.
Hence (X,C,F) is F-saturated.
The other half is more complicated.
However, we can determine conditions on when it is injective or surjective.
This means that the smooth functions do not separate x and y.
It is simple to construct non-Hausdorff Fr√∂licher spaces.
Indeed, the example earlier was one.
Surjectivity is more complicated.
As currently stated, not even very simple Fr√∂licher spaces satisfy the surjectivity condition.
However, all is not lost.
The set F of functions in a Fr√∂licher space is a commutative ‚Ñù-algebra.
Let (X,C,F) be a Fr√∂licher space.
Consider the function (5)Œ∏=(œà‚àíŒ±(œà)) 2+(œï‚àíŒ±(œï)) 2.
Since Œ±(Œ∏)‚ààimŒ∏, there is thus some x‚ààX such that Œ∏(x)=0.
For this x we therefore have that œà(x)=Œ±(œà) and œï(x)=Œ±(œï).
This clearly extends to any finite family.
This family is directed (downwards) since œïœà‚â§œï (and œà).

This approach can be generalized to the transfinite construction of free algebras.
Various constructions with simplicial toppological spaces find their natural home in this (‚àû,1)-topos.
The (‚àû,1)-topos ETop‚àûGrpd is a cohesive (‚àû,1)-topos.
For completeness we record general properties of cohesive (‚àû,1)-toposes implied by this.
We say that ETop‚àûGrpd defines Euclidean-topological cohesion.
This becomes a large site with the open cover coverage.
Accordingly the categories of sheaves are equivalent Sh(CartSp top)‚âÉSh(TopMfd).
This means that it is in particular a local (‚àû,1)-topos.
The functor j exhibits TopMfd as a full sub-(‚àû,1)-category of ETop‚àûGrpd TopMfd‚Ü™ETop‚àûGrpd.
With the above proposition this follows directly by the (‚àû,1)-Yoneda lemma.
We dicuss some aspects of the presentation of ETop‚àûGrpd by model category structures.
But by the above ETop‚àûGrpd already is hypercomplete.
The first condition is given by the first assumption.
Therefore this inclusion is full and faithful, the presheaf W¬ØG is a separated prestack.
On the other hand, let X‚ààMfd be any non-contractible manifold.
In the first case we need to construct the fibrant replacement GBund.
In practice the latter is often all that one needs.
For ETop‚àûGrpd among these are the simplicial topological groups.
See there for more details.
Accordingly we have Œ†(X)‚âÉ(ùïÉlim ‚Üí)(X)‚âÉlim ‚ÜíC(‚àê iU i‚ÜíX).
The classical nerve theorem asserts that this implies the claim.
We may regard Top itself as a cohesive (‚àû,1)-topos.
This is discussed at discrete ‚àû-groupoid.
We discuss the notion of geometric path ‚àû-groupoids realized in ETop‚àûGrpd.
In the above constructions of Œ†(X) the actual paths are not explicit.
We discuss here presentations of Œ†(X) in terms of actual paths.
By prop. we have
This implies the claim with prop. .
Typically one is interested in mapping out of Œ†(X).
Let A‚àà ‚àûGrpd be any discrete ‚àû-groupoid.
Write |A|‚àà Top for its geometric realization.
Proposition Let A‚àà ‚àûGrpd, write DiscA‚ààETop‚àûGrpd for the corresponding discrete topological ‚àû-groupoid.
From this the claim follows by the above proposition.
(Discussed at model structure on simplicial presheaves ‚Äì cofibrant replacement. )
But this is a model for |Œ†(X‚ÜíW¬ØG)|.
We discuss geometric Whitehead towers in ETop‚àûGrpd.
By the above proposition on the fundamental ‚àû-groupoid we have that Œ† n(X)‚âÉDiscSingX.
By induction over n this implies the claim.
Let C be an ‚àû-connected site.
See model structure on functors for details.
So SingU indeed is an ‚àû-groupoid of paths in U. Proposition
By construction this preserves all colimits.
Hence it preserves cofibrations and acyclic cofibrations.
Hence it preserves (‚àû,1)-colimits and so is determined on representatives.
There SingU‚âÉ* does coindice with Œ†(U)‚âÉ*, hence both (‚àû,1)-functors are equivalent.
This is a model for ‚àû-stacks on Diff.
Write SeqSpec(sSet) for this category of sequential spectra.
This constitutes a functor œÄ ‚Ä¢:SeqSpec(sSet)‚ü∂Ab ‚Ñ§.
This constitutes an endofunctor Q:SeqSpec(sSet)‚ü∂SeqSpec(sSet).
This is called the ‚Äústrict model structure‚Äù for sequential spectra.
It only remains to check that the cofibrations are as claimed.
Since components are parameterized over ‚Ñï, this condition has solutions by induction.
First of all there must be an ordinary lifting in degree 0.
In order to compare this to to sequential spectra consider also the following variant.
This is an sSet */ enriched equivalence of categories.

and shown to be the string Lie 2-algebra.
Let X be a set.
This is defined on all germs.
We can similarly consider higher differentials which depend on higher jets.
We do not know any more interesting examples.
For instance, any œâ has an absolute value |œâ|.
In particular, this applies to the metric g on any (pseudo)-Riemannian manifold.
This also enables us to calculate the iterated cogerm differentials of functions.
There are at least two possible definitions.
The (genuine) integral of œâ over c is defined as follows.
Now we take the limit as the tagged partitions shrink.
It is convenient to do this in the manner of the Henstock integral.
However, in other cases it disagrees with the naive integral.
Let us say that œâ is o(dx) if lim h‚Üí0‚ü®œâ|h‚ãÖc‚ü©h=0 for any curve c.
Some examples of forms that are o(dx) are dx 2 and d 2x.
This defines a gauge Œ¥ on [a,b].
Then the corresponding Riemann sum is, by definition, ‚àë i‚ü®œâ|Œîx i‚ãÖc t i‚ü©.
Thus, when we sum them up, we get something less than œµb‚àía‚àë iŒîx i=œµb‚àía(b‚àía)=œµ.
This leads us to integrate the differential form f(x)dx.
This would lead us to integrate the form f(x)dx+12f‚Ä≤(x)dx 2.
But with the naive integral, it does not.
This follows directly from the definition of the naive integral and the cogerm differential d.
But the existence of genuine integrals is rather less obvious.
Here we prove that they exist for at least one reasonably general class of forms.
Then the genuine integral of œâ over any differentiable curve exists.
Note that Œît i=t i‚àít i‚àí1 is always positive.
Since f is assumed continuous, this integral exists.
These are excluded by requirement (2).
However, for general cogerm 1-forms, neither integral is so invariant.
Nevertheless, we may ask for conditions under which they are.
The naive integral is very much not invariant under reparametrization.
The genuine integral is somewhat more invariant under reparametrization.
This follows fairly directly from its definition.
This is most easily done by reformulating the integral, as follows.
Thus, tangent-Lipschitz is a weak replacement for linearity in the tangent variable.
Then we can canonically identify all its tangent spaces with the same vector space V.
We now show that the affine integral agrees with the genuine integral.
Let c:[a,b]‚ÜíX be differentiable.
Then for the affine integrals we have ‚à´ cœï *œâ=‚à´ œïcœâ.
Thus, the two integrals agree.
In the list of examples above, we denoted f(x+dx)‚àíf(x) by Œîf.
However, it is again not clear whether left endpoints suffice.
Recall that this was Œ¥={1|dx| x=0anddx‚â†0 0 otherwise.
But this is positive, so the Riemann sum is simply f(0).
Thus, the integral equals f(0).
It is unclear to me whether this is possible.
When k=1, the definition is ‚ü®d‚àßœâ|c‚ü©=lim A‚Üí01‚ÄñA‚Äñ‚àÆ c(‚àÇA)œâ.
The definition for general k is similar.
That‚Äôs it, essentially.
Here is the list of reports, as planned so far:
In IntTrans the basic machinery of these ‚àû-categorical pull-push operations is established.
I want to start replying to/understanding this comment.
The ‚àû-categories that we are dealing with here are (‚àû,1)-categories.
2.1.1 Enhancing triangulated categories
Such a 2-vector space is in particular an abelian category.
It‚Äôs the most obvious thing in the world.
In order to formulate this, one needs a good general theory of higher algebra.
More generally, S itself may be an (‚àû,1)-category.
Or equivalently: H is an (‚àû,1)-category of (‚àû,1)-sheaves on S.
It is convenient and usual to switch back and forth between these two models.
In other words, this is ‚àû-stackification.
Describing the full ‚àû-stackification of a given (‚àû,1)-presheaf explicitly is usually hard.
Moreover, it is usually much more than one wants to actually know.
One often thinks of such X as orbifolds.
We still have a canonical inclusion X‚Ü™Œ†(X).
Morphisms from the fundamental ‚àû-groupoid are also called local systems.
which in turn are identified with the ‚àû-version of ‚àû-Hochschild homology?
So the ‚àû-kernel of an ‚àû-kernel is not 0, but is loops.
These loop space constructions see only homotopies which actually exist as morphisms.
The second statement is example 2.3.8 in EnAction.
The first seems to be clear but is maybe not in the literature.
Again, due to the good formalism, this statement becomes almost a tautology.
I‚Äôm shooting in the dark here with this œâ-groupoid sentence above.
What does that boil down to concretely?
As a slogan: integral transforms = colimit preserving functors
(If there is some inaccuracy noted by anyone, feel free to comment.
I might have forgotten some fibrant or cofibrant replacement somewhere.)
In our present context, we consider a morphism of perfect derived stacks q:X‚ÜíY.
This gives the absolute version of the equivalence we want.
Then some comparision takes place.
For this, we use the already established equivalence QC(X)‚äó QC(Y)QC(X)‚âÉQC(X√ó YX).
Then there is an equivalence QC(X Œ£)‚âÉQC(X)‚äóŒ£.
Someone may comment, or I‚Äôll come back to it later.
What‚Äôs a geometric stack?
Two geometric cases are of special interest.
That‚Äôs probably explained in section 6.
Its zeroth graded piece is of course just the classical center Z(A)=End A‚äóA op(A).
In particular, the ‚àí1st term is just A.

The terminal object is the limit of the empty functor F:‚àÖ‚ÜíSet.
This has more natural interpretations in certain special cases.
So this is given by restricting f to the elements that are mapped into B.
Thus the limit is given by the set of natural transformations from const 1 to F.
This is given by the empty set ‚àÖ.
We discuss limits and colimits in the category Top of topological spaces.
But this is precisely what the initial topology ensures.
The case of the colimit is formally dual.
However, this style of reasoning does not easily generalize to higher category theory.
The following gives a more abstract argument that is short and generalizes.
We state it in (‚àû,1)-category theory just for definiteness of notation:
Its limit is the product ‚àè ic i of these.
if D={a‚Üí‚Üíb} then limF is the equalizer of the two morphisms F(b)‚ÜíF(a).

Similarly for colimits Similarly colimits of presheaves are computed objectwise.
The Yoneda embedding does not in general preserve colimits.
Limits in under categories are a special case of limits in comma categories.
This is what the following does.
Limits in an under category are computed as limits in the underlying category.
Let F:D‚Üít/C be any functor.
It therefore remains to show that this is indeed a limiting cone over F.
Again, this is immediate from the universal property of the limit in C.
This demonstrates the required universal property of t‚ÜílimpF and thus identifies it with limF.
This property is used in Nagata-Smirnov metrization theorem:

WISC implies (in ZF) that there exist arbitrarily large regular cardinals.
A proof without large cardinals was given in (Karagila).
The underlying map on object sets is U‚ÜíX 0.
By WISC there is a surjection V‚ÜíX 0 and a map V‚ÜíU over X 0.
This definition is called external because it refers to an external category of sets.
This is to be contrasted with the internal version of WISC, discussed below.
This does not satisfy WISC.
In this paper WISC is called the ‚Äúaxiom of multiple choice‚Äù.
In this paper WISC is called the ‚Äúaxiom of multiple choice‚Äù.

Let ùíû be a category, and let *‚ààùíû be an object.
And formally dual (example ): Let ‚àÖ‚ààùíû be an object.
(initial object is limit over identity functor)
Let ùíû be a category, and let ‚àÖ‚ààùíû be an object.
First let ‚àÖ be an initial object.
This proves that i ‚àÖ is the limiting cone.
We need to show that its tip ‚àÖ is an initial object.
Now consider any morphism of the form ‚àÖ‚Üífx.
(limits of presheaves are computed objectwise)
Hence it remains to see that this cone of presheaves is indeed universal.
More in detail, let X ‚Ä¢:‚Ñê‚ü∂ùíû be a diagram.
The argument that shows the preservation of colimits by L is analogous.
But under a number of special conditions of interest they do.
Special cases and concrete examples are discussed at commutativity of limits and colimits.
A functor R:ùíû‚ü∂ùíü (Def. )
First assume that the left adjoint exist.
We need to show that this yields a left adjoint.

Let ùíû be a small ùí±-enriched category (Def. ).
, let G‚ààùí± be a group object.
There is the n the one-object ùí±-enriched category BG as in Example .
Hence this is equivalently an action of G on X.
In this form the statement is also known as Yoneda reduction.
Remark (internal hom preserves ends)
Let ùí± be a cosmos (Def. ).
This is called the tensoring of [ùíû,ùí±] over ùí±.
If ùíû is equipped with a (co-)powering it is called (co-)powered over ùí±.
let ùíû be a ùí±-enriched category (Def. ).
We discuss the first claim, the second is formally dual.
By prop. , tensoring is a left adjoint.
But the above equivalence relation is precisely that under which this composite would be invariant.
We collect here further key properties of the various universal constructions considered above.

Set Œ∏ a=Œ∑¬Ø A.
So f¬Ø satisfies the unit condition.
Their mates under the adjunction (TŒ∏ a,1):Ta‚ä£TŒ∑ A are given by pasting with TŒ∑ A.
There is a modification m:Œº‚àòŒ∑T‚Üí1 making (1,m):Œ∑T‚ä£Œº.
There is a modification e:Œ∑T‚ÜíTŒ∑ such that eŒ∑=1 and Œºe=1.
In the case of pseudo algebras, this necessary condition is also sufficient.
Thus, T-algebra structure is property-like structure.
Algebras of this sort are sometimes called continuous algebras.
In this case, the 2-monad is a free cocompletion operation.
The monad p‚Ü¶p/B is lax-idempotent, and its algebras are opfibrations.
This latter is actually a special case of a general situation.

Higher symplectic geometry is the generalization of symplectic geometry to the context of higher geometry.
It involves two kinds of generalizations:

the base manifold is generalized to a smooth ‚àû-groupoid or ‚àû-Lie algebroid.
For binary symplectic forms this is called a symplectic Lie n-algebroid.

Actually, the reader need not even know anything about topological spaces.
The reader can jump right to The basic idea of sheaves.
Classes of maps between topological spaces encode interesting information.
See at geometry of physics for more on this.
So, to be fair, I should provide a bit more information.
In other words, your map U‚ÜíV induces a transformation X(U)‚ÜêX(V).
To be fair, I should tell you at least what this transformation is!
Well, fine: I‚Äôll do it.
Do you need still more information to guess my space X?
No, you have enough!
These terms will be discussed in a moment‚Ä¶
Here are some important examples:
Sheaves on Op(Z) are generalized spaces over Z.
And in fact, this is the generic case.
The notion of ‚Äúgeneralized‚Äù here depends on the perspective of our probes.
These may be very different from ordinary manifolds and ordinary topological spaces.
There are generalized smooth spaces with a single point and still many curves in them.
luckily it doesn‚Äôt, as one can check
Both notions of maps, while defined differently, happen to be perfectly equivalent.
It turns out that we can keep going this way.
One says that such f U is a weak homotopy equivalence.
One says one picks a resolution.
We come back to our original motivation.
Another term for this generalized cohomology theory thus obtained is nonabelian cohomology.
It turns out that sheaf cohomology is precisely the abelian part of general cohomology.
Here is what ‚Äúabelian part of general cohomology‚Äù means:
From a more modern perspective all these are just tools for unraveling an independent reality.
This also explains why there are so many different tools which yield the same results.
We had wanted to obtain a generalized notion of space such that this is remedied.
Indeed, this is now the case.
In particular we have Proposition
In the internal language, this says P Xf={(B,x)‚ààPA√óX:(‚àÄb‚ààB)f(b)=x}.
The map to X is given by projection onto the second factor.
See at topos of coalgebras over a comonad.
This result also subsumes the weaker result where G is assumed to preserve finite limits.
See the Elephant, Section A, Remark 4.2.3.
A proof of a still more general result may be found here.
Therefore by the adjoint functor theorem a further right adjoint X * exists.
By universal colimits in ‚Ñ∞ the pullback functor f * preserves both limits and colimits.
Then there is an equivalence of categories PSh(‚à´ CP)‚âÉPSh(C)/P.
The inverse takes f:Q‚ÜíP to i ‚àí1(f)(A,p‚ààP(A))=f A ‚àí1(p).
In particular, this equivalence shows that slices of presheaf toposes are presheaf toposes.
We discuss topos points of over-toposes.
The claim then follows with the assumption that ‚Ñ∞ has enough points.
Both of these have accompanying model structures.
cofibrations are the ‚Äúretracts of relative cell complexes‚Äù.
This is a cofibrantly generated model category.
From the definitions, Hurewicz fibrations are necessarily Serre fibrations.
It is well-known that homotopy equivalences are weak homotopy equivalences.
This appears as (Hovey, prop. 4.2.11).
This statement is called the homotopy hypothesis (which here is a theorem).

how does topology enter?
Notice that dRB(X) does depend covariantly on X.
This means that Fun ‚äó(dRB(X),TV) is contravariant in X.
Instead, it is a map that comes from integration over fibers.
In particular it will change the degree of cohomology theories.
suppose E‚àà2‚àíRFT(X) is a 2d Riemmanian field theory.
let Œ≥:S 1‚ÜíX be a loop in X.
then E(Œ≥) is a vector space.
So this is a problem for the definition of field theories so far.
This introduces locality into FQFTs, at the expense of working with n-categories.
This will however not be studied here for the moment.
This requires to replace manifolds by supermanifolds.
Example let d=0 and consider 0-dimensional TFTs over X.
This is not quite what is intended.
We want to see smooth maps on the right.
To get that, we need to talk about smooth functors on the left.
So turning this into an Eilenberg-Steenrod theory yields the trivial theory.
The way out to that will be to go to supermanifolds.
these two passes cannot easily be interleaved due to their differing direction.
Let us fix some class of categories with stuff S.

Of course, any perfect set has the perfect-set property.
The empty space is perfect (unless it is excluded by fiat).
The real line is perfect.

Furthermore, any closed subset of a Polish space has the perfect-set property.
This makes the continuum hypothesis a theorem of dream mathematics.
As such they are analogous to real numbers.

The theory of simplicial weak ‚àû-categories is based on stratified simplicial sets.
The elements of tX are called the thin simplices of X.
The category of stratified simplicial sets and stratified maps between them is usually denoted Strat.
This category is a quasitopos.
Hence, in particular, it is cartesian closed.
A complicial set is a stratified simplicial set satisfying certain extra conditions.
(Notice that this is not closed, as far as I understand.)

There are two crucially different uses of the term:
For more on this notion turn to the entry (‚àû,1)-category.
With this counting then an ‚Äú‚àû-category‚Äù is some limiting notion of (‚àû,‚àû)-category.
With this meaning one also often speaks of ‚àû-categories.
It is also much harder to formalize.

The existence of the Bousfield localization has to be shown by hand.

This immediately raises the question for natural classes of examples of such prequantizations.
The prequantum n-bundles arising this way are the higher WZW terms discussed here.
We have œâ=Œº(Œ∏)where Œ∏ is the Maurer-Cartan form on G.
In the example of Spin and p=1 this extension is the string 2-group.
As such, this is also known as the WZW gerbe or similar.
This terminology arises as follows.
This is equivalently the ‚àá that we just motivated above.
Here we discuss the general construction and theory of such higher WZW terms.
So let ùî§ be an L-‚àû algebra of finite type.
We find further characterization of this below in corollary , see remark .
This is no longer the case for general smooth ‚àû-groups G.
Remark The WZW term of def.
With this the statement follows by lemma .
The homotopy limit over that last cospan, in turn, is G^Àú.

For valuation in algebra (on rings/fields) see at valuation.
Let L be a distributive lattice with a bottom element ‚ä•.
Note that, differently from measures, there is no explicit mention of complements.
See correspondence between measure and valuation theory for more on this.
Let L be a locale.
Then a valuation on L is by definition a valuation on its frame ùí™(L).
Let X be a topological space, and let x‚ààX be a point.
For more on this, see œÑ -additive measure.
Then the restriction of Œº to the open subsets of X is a valuation.
The valuation is continuous if and only if Œº is œÑ -additive.
Valuations share a number of constructions which are similar to those for measures.
The constructions below are given for the case of continuous valuations on topological spaces.
We call f *ŒΩ the pushforward valuation of ŒΩ along f.
Compare with the analogous construction for measures.
Note that this is not enough to define a valuation a priori.
Valuations admit a notion of support similar to that of measures.
We say that U is a null or measure zero set for ŒΩ if ŒΩ(U)=0.
The way to define integration, mutatis mutandis, parallels usual Lebesgue integral construction.
We sketch the construction for the case of topological spaces.
Let ŒΩ be a valuation on a space X.
A simple lower semicontinuous function is a lower semicontinuous function assuming only finitely many values.
We define the integral of a simple f as ‚à´fdŒΩ‚âî‚àë ir iŒΩ(U i).

Take an increasing net (g Œ±) Œ±‚ààA of nonnegative simple lower semicontinuous functions.

Extending valuations to measures
As we have seen above, a Borel measure always restricts to a valuation.
In general, the answer is negative.
This includes in particular every metric space, and every compact Hausdorff space.
Particular cases Every Dirac valuation can be extended to the corresponding Dirac measure.
(Equivalently, the restriction of measures to valuations is a natural transformation).
(See also the measure monad on Top.)
Such groups often make their appearance as fundamental groups of interesting topological spaces.
They are apt to invite topological / geometric methods.
That is why (ii) is needed.
The commutative case is rather classical.
In contrast, (2,1)-toposes are much better understood.
See also higher topos theory.
In that case, Giraud's theorem famously characterizes sheaf toposes.
This characterization has a 2-categorical analog: the 2-Giraud theorem.
By the 2-Giraud theorem, ùí≥ is an exact 2-category.
With this, the first statement is this theorem at 2-congruence.
With this the second and third statement is this theorem at 2-congruence.
This is in stark contrast to the situation for an ambient 1-category.
The generalization of this phenomenon is discussed at category object in an (‚àû,1)-category.
The archetypical 2-topos is Cat.
This plays the role for 2-toposes as Set does for 1-toposes.

Distinguish it from the concept of the transposed operator?
For more see at geometry of physics.
There is another notion of determinant for quaternionic matrices, the Study determinant.
It clearly obeys det S(ST)=det S(S)det S(T),det S(1)=1.
This latter condition is called local simple-connectedness.
A semi-locally simply connected space need not be locally simply connected.
For a simple counterexample, take the cone on the Hawaiian earring space.
The cardinality of a finite set is a finite number.
This larger object is then called the completion of C with respect to these properties.
That would be the construction of downsets or ideals.
Note that these completions take small categories to large categories.
Free completions and cocompletions of large categories can be obtained using categories of accessible presheaves.
This is an example of an injective hull.
However, this is far from unique.
An example of a special type of a fork is an equalizer.
Another example is a reflexive fork, where C=A and fe=1 A.
A locally constant function is a function whose value never changes.
They correspond on a connected space.
a locally constant ‚àû-stack is a section of a constant ‚àû-stack.
A locally constant sheaf / ‚àû-stack is also called a local system.
We include several intuitive explanations below.
Here we collect some possible ways to understand ‚Öã intuitively.
Disentangling additivity from disjunctive syllogism
If we can prove A, we can prove A‚à®B.
Dually, if we can prove B, we can prove A‚à®B.
If assuming ¬¨A we can prove B, then we can prove A‚à®B.
Dually, if assuming ¬¨B we can prove A, we can prove A‚à®B.
If we have A‚à®B and also ¬¨A, then we can conclude B.
Dually, if we have A‚à®B and also ¬¨B, then we can conclude A.

This dictionary implies a wealth of useful tools for handling and reasoning about geometry:
Asheaf toposAAas category of generalized spaces AAYoneda embedding: AAcontains and generalizes ordinary spaces A
Ahas all limits: AAcontains all Cartesian products and intersections A
Ahas all colimits: AAcontains all disjoint unions and quotients
This is discussed in the following chapters on smooth sets and on supergeometry.
Similar comments apply to a wealth of other topics of mathematics.
Duality is of course an ancient notion in philosophy.
In both cases, the literature left some room in delineating what precisely is meant.
This allows to explore the possibility that there is more than a coincidence of terms.
All this is discussed in the chapter on fundamental super p-branes.
Here we introduce the requisites for understanding these statements.
This constitutes what is sometimes called the language of categories.
This we turn to further below.
But not all categories are ‚Äúconcrete‚Äù in this way.
Let ùíû be a category (Def. ).
Clearly, these are small categories (Def. ).
Let (S,‚â§) be a preordered set.
In fact every groupoid with precisely one object is of the form.
Let ùíû be a category.
This relation is known as formal duality.
Let ùíû and ùíü be two categories (Def. ).
Accordingly, this composition is unital and associative.
Let ùíû be a category (Def. ).
A fully faithful functor is also called a full subcategory-inclusion.
This is called the full subcategory of ùíû on the objects in S.
See at structure for more on this.
Notice that the formal Cartesian spaces ‚Ñù n|q are fully defined by this assignment.
Notice that the super Cartesian spaces ‚Ñù n|q are fully defined by this assignment.
We discuss this in more detail in the chapter on supergeometry.
This innocent-looking lemma is the heart that makes category theory tick.
This follows by inspection, as shown in the third line above.
This is concept that category theory, as a theory, is all about.
A Acounit is iso:AAreflectionA ADef.
Conversely, f is called the adjunct of fÀú.
Below in Example we identify adjoint triples as adjunctions of adjunctions.
Similarly there are adjoint quadruples, etc.
This is clearly already the defining condition on the floor function ‚åäx‚åã.
This is evidently already the defining condition on the floor function ‚åäx‚åã.
But Functions between such sets are unique, when they exist.
These hence form an adjoint triple (Remark ) Disc‚ä£U‚ä£coDisc.
We now consider a sequence of equivalent reformulations of the condition of adjointness.
The converse formula follows analogously.
The argument for the naturality of œµ is directly analogous.
Hence it remains to show the converse.
We consider one more equivalent characterization of adjunctions:
In one direction, assume a left adjoint L is given.
Then the statement that this really is a universal arrow is implied by Prop. .
In the other direction, assume that universal arrows Œ∑ c are given.
There is a canonical functor F/c ‚ü∂ ùíü.
The other case is directly analogous.
Suppose that R 1,R 2:ùíû‚Üíùíü are two functors which both are right adjoint to L.
To complete this pattern, we will see below in Prop.
We consider the first case, the second is formally dual (Example ).
Next let c 1‚Ü™fc 2 be a monomorphism.
But the main preservation property of adjoint functors is that adjoints preserve (co-)limits.
Example (adjunctions of adjoint pairs are adjoint triples)
Let ùíû be a strict 2-category (Def. ).
These are also called strict 2-functors.
This is called an equivalence of categories (Def. below).
Let ùíû, ùíü be two categories (Def. ).
Let ùíû, ùíü be two categories (Def. ).
Let ùíû and ùíü be two categories (Def. ).
The second claim is formally dual.
In conclusion, we have the following three equivalent perspectives on modalities.
This is the most common flavor of representations.
See characters of linear representations.
Their Chern classes are hence invariants of the linear representations themselves.
See at characteristic class of a linear representation for more.
For more see the references at representation theory.
Automath was historically the first logical framework.
Automath Restaurant has examples of different foundations of mathematics encoded in Automath.
It uses the notion of ‚Äútelescope‚Äù.
The analytic-synthetic distinction has a long history stretching back to the ancient Greeks.
The solution is thought to be put together (œÉœÖŒΩœÑŒØŒ∏Œ∑ŒºŒπ).
Thus it analyses, or unravels (·ºÄŒΩŒ±Œªœçœâ), the problem.
Often analytic discovery was written up in synthetic fashion.
In the seventeenth century, Descartes understood the distinction in the same way.
Kant famously disagreed with this claim.
A famous example is ‚ÄòAll bachelors are unmarried.‚Äô
This is sometimes glossed today as true by virtue of definition.
Ascertaining that bodies are heavy unavoidably requires empirical sensation.
Wherever you must construct an element to establish a proposition, that proposition is synthetic.
In the context of string theory real spaces appear as orientifold target spacetimes.
The involution fixed points here are known as O-planes.

Let C be a semiabelian category.
Here the notion of internal groupoid is the usual diagrammatic notion.
The two diagrams can be translated into equations, which may often be helpful.
In other words, Œ¥ is equivariant for the action of G 1.
The first diagram is slightly more subtle.
The first diagram says that the two actions coincide.
Equationally this gives: Œ¥(g 2)g 2 ‚Ä≤=g 2g 2 ‚Ä≤g 2 ‚àí1.
This equation is known as the Peiffer rule in the literature.
See there for more details.
Thus the category of modules over groups embeds in the category of crossed modules.
There is an induced map on homotopy groups œÄ 1(F)‚ü∂œÄ 1(i)œÄ 1(E)
With this action (œÄ 1(F),œÄ(E),œÄ 1(i)) is a crossed module.
This will not be proved here, but is not that difficult.
What is fun is that this generalises to ‚Äòhigher dimensions‚Äô.)
Whitehead‚Äôs proof of this theorem used knot theory and transversality.
proved a key result on ‚ÄúFree crossed modules‚Äù.
There this is called the ‚Äúdaseinisation‚Äù of a.

In this sense quasicoherent sheaves of modules are a generalization of vector bundles.
In particular, it is not an abelian category.
There are several different but equivalent ways to define and think of quasicoherent sheaves.
This is the definition given in the section As locally presentable modules below.
This is the perspective described in As hom objects below.
This is described in As cartesian morphisms of fibered categories
This is discussed in the section Higher quasicoherent sheaves.
(See there for details.)
Here is a more detailed way to say again what the above paragraph said.
An O-module is a presheaf of O-modules.
Usually some Grothendieck topology is given and one asks for sheaves in fact.
We can Yoneda extend O-modules to presheaves.
Clearly, Aff and O can be much generalized.
We now explain the above statement in detail and thereby prove it.
Let C=Ring op be the category of (commutative, unital) rings.
For R a ring write SpecR for it regarded as an object of C.
Consider the 2-category of (pre)stacks on C.
Consider X‚àà[C op,Set] any (pre)sheaf on C.
We write for short QC(X):=(Ran YQC)(X):=[C op,Cat](X,QC).
The components of N are
Under the above identification, this yields the cocycle condition mentioned in the above definitions.
This general nonsense is considered further at ‚àû-vector bundle.
Concrete realizations are discussed at quasicoherent ‚àû-stack.
Let ùí¢ be a geometry (for structured (‚àû,1)-toposes).
Let X be a scheme.

For this reason, it is common to write simply ‚àÖ instead of ‚àÖ A.
In the context of topology, we often speak of the empty subspace.
The formally dual concept is that of disjoint union topological spaces.
By definition of disjoint union there is a bijection of underlying sets X‚äîX‚âÉX√ó{1,2}.
Under the above bijection the we have U‚äîV=(U√ó{1})‚à™(V√ó{2}).
Then the product topological spaces satisfy ‚Ñù n 1√ó‚Ñù n 2‚âÉ‚Ñù n 1+n 2.
Then the infinite product space ‚àèn‚àà‚Ñ§Disc(S) is itself not a discrete space.
The open subsets of a discrete space include all the subsets of the underlying set.
Then {1}‚äÇS is a proper subset.
Accordingly the product subset ‚àèn‚ààùîπ{1}‚äÇ‚àèn‚àà‚ÑïDisc(S) is not open.
Write Disc({0,1}) for the the discrete topological space with two points.
This image is the Cantor space as a subspace of the closed interval.

This is briefly mentioned in Bredon 93, p. 199.
The Tychonoff topology is named after A. N. Tychonoff.
This is a sub-entry for gerbe.
An important class of sheaves are the torsors.
Let G be a sheaf of groups on B.
The category, Tors(B;G) of G-torsors on B is a groupoid.
(We abuse notation and just write Tors(U;G) for the corresponding groupoid.
It thus corresponds to a Grothendieck fibration or fibred category over Open(B).
(Roughly ‚Äòmorphisms glue, objects glue up to isomorphism‚Äô.
This stack will be called ùíØors(G).
There is a stackcompletion functor from fibred categories to stacks.
If we stack complete it, we get ‚Ä¶ ùíØors(G).
A groupoid need not have any objects ‚Ä¶ if it is empty!
So a group is a very special type of groupoid.
It is non-empty and connected.
Or maybe this comment should go in gerbe (general idea)?
Important example Proposition ùíØors(G) is a gerbe on B. Proof
Next look at ùíØors(G)(U) again.
We thus have that ùíØors(G) is a gerbe.
Fix a sheaf of abelian (possibly not necessary) groups ùíú on B.
Further references are given in the other entries on gerbes.

More abstractly, Adams operations can be defined on any Lambda-ring.
They are an example of power operations.
While explicit, this definition may look contrived on first sight.
This is proposition below.
Moreover, the first two of these already uniquely characterize the Adams operations.
Every groupoid is a quasigroupoid.
Every loopoid and associative quasigroupoid is a quasigroupoid.
A one-object quasigroupoid is a quasigroup.
A quasigroupoid enriched in truth values is an equivalence relation.
Therefore every ‚àû-stack on Diff may be presented by a simplicial manifold.

We present such a proof here.
Triangle ABF is similar to triangle BFN.
Triangle BAK is similar to triangle KAN.
Adding our two results, we have: BF 2+AK 2=AB‚ãÖ(AN+BN)=AB 2.
So we have established the pentagon-decagon-hexagon identity.
Euclid‚Äôs proof is quick but somewhat mysterious.
Here is another, perhaps simpler, proof that uses only 2-dimensional constructions.
In the diagram above, triangle BDE is similar to triangle BEC.
By the definition of the golden ratio, rt=Œ¶.
So the product of r and 2b is t 2.
The large tilted square has a hypotenuse as its side.
The other twelve faces will be isosceles triangles, all congruent to each other.
How far can we go in that direction?
The five vertices that project onto the line segment ZSQ will form another pentagon.
These two pentagons are shown in the diagram below.
These clues led Greg Egan to the present proof.
Avoiding the intermediate value theorem
Finally, suppose we wish to avoid using the intermediate value theorem.
The altitude CM 1 of this triangle is the radius of the decagon.
The altitude VM 1 is the radius of the hexagon.
And the altitude WM 1 is the radius of the pentagon.
From the dual Pythagorean theorem, this establishes the pentagon-decagon-hexagon identity.
This yields the following results:
See page 102‚Äì103 here and page 104 here.
A formal system is complete or semantically complete when all its tautologies are theorems.
This is generally known as the completeness theorem.
However, there are many such isomorphisms; the automorphism group is ‚ÑÇ‚àñ{0}.
An equivalence class is an element of a quotient set.
There are a variety of ways to make this precise.
Let S be a set, and let ‚àº be an equivalence relation on S.
Then there exists a set S/‚àº, the quotient set of S modulo ‚àº.
Every element of S/‚àº is of this form.
Let x be an element of S.
Then the quotient set S/‚àº is the collection of these equivalence classes.
Every equivalence class has at least one representative, and its representatives are all equivalent.
The set of representatives is the equivalence class in the material set-theoretic sense.
This does not require the axiom of choice.
This describes one approach to weakly enriching in the 2-dimensional case.
A category weakly enriched in a monoidal bicategory W is called a W-bicategory.
These 2-cells are required to satsify higher dimensional coherence axioms.
A Cat-bicategory is an ordinary bicategory.
In the context of (‚àû,1)-category theory see at enriched (‚àû,1)-category.

Let f:M‚ÜíN be a smooth map of smooth manifolds.

In Cat, the left class consists of (possibly transfinitely) iterated localizations.
Main applications are in study of topology of singular spaces and in geometric representation theory.

We may also define an ultrafilter to be maximal among the proper filters.
There are in fact many interrelated ways of defining ultrafilters.
We present a few here.
Ultrafilters form a monad
For any set X, let UX be the set of ultrafilters on X.
The multiplication can be described fairly explicitly.
This monad is traditionally denoted Œ≤.
The ultrafilter monad can also be described as follows.
See Leinster for a full account, and some extensions.
The endofunctor Œ≤ is terminal among endofunctors Set‚ÜíSet that preserve finite coproducts.
This gives one universal characterization of the ultrafilter endofunctor.
Another known universal characterization of the ultrafilter monad is via the concept of codensity monads.
Let i:Fin‚ÜíSet be the usual full inclusion of finite sets into sets.
(Here i +:Fin +‚ÜíSet denotes the standard inclusion.)
We may denote this by (‚àí) X for short.
There are other descriptions of ultrafilters, based on k-valued Post algebras.
The forgetful functor U k:BoolAlg‚ÜíM k-Set is full and faithful.
Let us take for example k=3.
Lawvere gives a couple more examples of a more geometric nature.
It is not hard to verify that this condition indeed defines a topology.
The monad Œ≤ also extends to the bicategory Rel of sets and binary relations.
Thus, compact Hausdorff spaces are to topological spaces as monoidal categories are to multicategories.
A proof may be found at independent family of sets.

, connected morphisms are representably co-fully-faithful in Topos.
The reflector constructs ‚ÄúŒ† 0 of a locally connected topos.‚Äù
These results all have generalizations to ‚àû-connected (‚àû,1)-toposes.
Then the over-topos ‚Ñ∞/X is also connected and locally connected.
This makes ‚Ñ∞/X be a locally connected topos.
Notice that the terminal object of ‚Ñ∞/X is (X‚ÜíIdX).
By the above proposition this means that ‚Ñ∞/X is also connected.

Here we discuss the latter.
Two such are taken to be equivalent, f‚àºg, if ‚Äñf‚àíg‚Äñ p=0.

The first proof was given in (Zermelo 1904).
(This does require excluded middle, however.)
The large principles do not follow from the small ones.

In the strict 2-category of categories, equifiers can be computed as follows.
The above explicit definition makes it clear that any equifier is a fully faithful morphism.
Any strict equifier is, in particular, an equifier.

Strict equifiers are, by definition, a particular case of PIE-limits.
Similarly there there is the full subcategory FinGrp‚Ü™Grp of finite groups.
This is because the only pointed intertwiner between two homomorphisms is the identity.
Precisely analogous statements hold for the category Alg of algebras.
The category of groups is also balanced.
Here we give a constructive proof.
This carries a G-module structure defined by (g‚ãÖf)(g‚Ä≤)=f(g‚Ä≤g).
We claim that i:H‚ÜíG is the equalizer of the pair œï,œà.
The category of groups is balanced: every epic mono is an isomorphism.
Every epimorphism in the category of groups is a coequalizer.
Indeed, (regular) monos are in Grp not stable under pushouts.
A purely mathematical definition of the intended class of functions is given below.
Clearly the primitive recursive functions are a subclass of partial recursive functions.
Similarly, a primitive recursive relation is a relation whose characteristic function is primitive recursive.
The factorial function n‚Ü¶n! is primitive recursive.
It is defined by the recursion x‚àí‚ãÖ0=x, x‚àí‚ãÖ(y+1)=Pred(x‚àí‚ãÖy).
So ‚Äúequals zero‚Äù is a computable relation.
Therefore the equality relation |x‚àíy|=0 is a primitive recursive relation.
Hence Boolean combinations of primitive recursive relations are primitive recursive.
By the aforementioned properties, this g is manifestly primitive recursive.
However, we do have a sample theorem as follows.
The bounded least choice property shows that f(x) is primitive recursive.
(The converse holds by one of the properties listed above.)
But this function is simply f.
Corollary The inverse of a recursive bijection f is also recursive.
The Ackermann function A:‚Ñï‚Üí‚Ñï is defined by A(m)=A m(m).
(The function is named after Wilhelm Ackermann.
It does however belong to the class of partial recursive functions.
By property 1 above, A 0 is primitive recursive.
We also have n<A n(3) for all n. Lemma
(We say f is dominated by A n, for short.)
In the case where f is constant with value m, take n=m.
For f the successor, use n=0.
Now proceed by induction on the construction of primitive recursive functions.
Indeed, this is true by assumption for y=0.
The Ackermann function A is not primitive recursive.
In that case, œï is dominated by A n for some n‚â•3.
We then arrive at the contradiction A n(n)+1=œï(n)‚â§A n(max{3,n})=A n(n).
The graph of the Ackermann function is a primitive recursive relation.
(Explicitly, the iteration is y i+1‚âîA x‚àíi(y i‚àí1).)
This shows that the ternary predicate A x(y)=z is primitive recursive.
Here we exhibit a primitive recursive bijection whose inverse is not primitive recursive.
Observe that both I and its complement ¬¨I in ‚Ñï are infinite.
It is a bijection by construction.
Of course, there is always good old Wikipedia: Wikipedia, Computable function
Some examples of semicartesian monoidal categories that are not cartesian include the following.
This monoidal product is semicartesian.
If so, it is a theorem that C is a cartesian monoidal category.
So, suppose (C,‚äó,1) is a semicartesian symmetric monoidal category.
The unique map e x:x‚ÜíI is a monoidal natural transformation.
The converse is also true.
For that one needs extra axioms; see this cafe discussion for details.

Thorsten Altenkirch is an associate professor for computer science at University of Nottingham.
Proposition The coproduct in Top of a small family of paracompacta is a paracompactum.
The proof is very easy.
A closed subspace A of a paracompactum X is also a paracompactum.
Finally, A is Hausdorff because Hausdorffness is a hereditary property.
For the sake of convenience, we reproduce the proof given here.
To prove that j is a subspace, let U‚äÜC be any open set.
It follows that j ‚àí1(W)=U, so that j is a subspace inclusion.
(See also Michael's theorems.)
For now we omit giving the proof (given in Michael).
Before applying this theorem, we need a few lemmas that play supporting roles.
The next result is an important observation about extending continuous selections.
We check that S is lsc.
If x‚àà¬¨A, this is clear since ¬¨A‚à©œÄ X(S‚à©(X√óV))=¬¨A‚à©œÄ X(R‚à©(X√óV) is open.
Now we put Michael‚Äôs selection theorem to use in developing colimits of paracompacta.
(Compare a similar result for normal spaces, here.)
Thus we have only to prove p admits a section.
Let j n:X n‚ÜíX denote a component of the colimit cocone.

This page is about object classifier objects in (‚àû,1)-toposes.
A crucial ingredient in a topos is a subobject classifier.
This is made precise in the context of (‚àû,1)-topos theory.
This statement is originally due to Charles Rezk.
It is reproduced as (Lurie HTT, theorem 6.1.6.8).
See there for more details and see at relation between category theory and type theory.
It possesses an internal (‚àû,1)-topos structure.
See also (WdL, book 2, section 1).
For instance, every topos has a subobject classifier.
For instance, every (2,1)-topos has a discrete object classifier.
For each object X, a subobject classifier classifies the subobjects of X.
For each object X, an object classifier classifies the objects over X.
This is HTT, notation 6.1.3.4 and HTT, def. 6.1.6.1.
This is (HTT, def. 6.1.6.1).
This appears as (HTT, prop. 6.1.6.3) and the remark below that.
Every (‚àû,1)-topos has a discrete object classifier.
This is due to Charles Rezk.

Then K, called the Kuratowski monoid, has at most 14 elements.

Proposition A regular space X with a countable base is normal.
Let A,B be disjoint closed sets of X.

A completely regular space X with countable base can be embedded in [0,1] ‚Ñï.

Then f factors as a dominant geometric morphism d followed by a closed inclusion c.
Since d 1 is surjective, it is dominant (cf. above).

Rational equivalence generalizes linear equivalence? of Weil divisors.
It is an example of an adequate equivalence relation.
The dual notion is that of a coseparator.
See Definition B2.4.1 in the Elephant.
Progenerators are important in classical Morita theory, see Morita equivalence.
The notion of extremal separator admits an equivalent reformulation not referencing coproducts:
The functors C(S i,‚àí):C‚ÜíSet are jointly faithful for every separator.
It remains to show that f is a monomorphism.
For this, let u,v:X‚ÜíA such that fu=fv.
Given A‚ààC, joint faithfulness implies that Œµ A is epic.
If C is balanced, then every separator is extremal.
If C has pullbacks, then every extremal separator is strong.
If C is regular, then every strong separator is regular.
The converse implications do always hold.
Finally, the strongest kind of separator commonly seen is that of dense separator.
Among these are the infinitesimal gauge symmetries which will be of concern below.

This describes infinitesimal translations of the fields in the direction of ‚àÇ ŒΩ.
This conserved current is called the energy-momentum tensor.
This is called the Dirac current.

Example (source forms and evolutionary vector fields are field-dependent sections)
It is sufficient to check this in local coordinates.
Let (E,L) be a Lagrangian field theory.
But the Lie derivative of the component functions is just their plain derivative.
Therefore it is sufficient to show that v^(Œ¥ ELLŒ¥œï a)| ‚Ñ∞ ‚àû=0.
Write ‚Ñ∞‚Ü™J Œ£ ‚àû(E) for the shell (?).
For the conserved currents this is sometimes known as the Dickey bracket Lie algebra.
For the Hamiltonian forms it is the Poisson bracket Lie p+1-algebra.
We call this the local Poisson Lie bracket.
First we need to check that the bracket is well defined in itself.
This shows that the bracket is well defined.
Consider the Lagrangian field theory for the free real scalar field from example .

Any linear functor from spaces to spaces is a generalized cohomology theory.
Really I should be using pointed spaces here.
The fibrant objects are precisely those functors which are linear in Goodwillie‚Äôs sense.
So now why should spectra/cohomology theories be thought of as linear functors?
This is a linear functor which is the best approximation to the original functor.
So it is like taking a derivative of a function.
Goodwillie‚Äôs insight was to extend this analogy to encompass the rudiments of calculus.

This is exactly the claimed ùî§-equivariance of the pairing.
These are the standard supersymmetry algebras in the physics literature.
Hence we get an ‚Äúexotic‚Äù super-extension of the Poincar√© Lie algebra.

Now we write out the supersymmetry algebra thus obtained more explicitly.
We discuss the classification of possible supersymmetry super Lie algebras.

Refinement is a partial order on the class of partitions of S.
Refinement corresponds to implication between relations.
Partitions of S are also closely related to surjections out of S.
In general, many different surjections can map to the same partition under this correspondence.
A partition may also be defined as a monotone composition.

We first prove the Hom-characterization from the definition.
Given (i,œï:L(x,i)‚Üíy), we get Œ±(œï):=Rœï‚àòŒ∑ x,i:x‚ÜíRy.
The definition demands that this is an isomorphism.
To see naturality, let œá:y‚Üíz.
Now let Œ± be given.
Then we define Œ∑ x,i=Œ±(i,id):x‚ÜíRL(x,i).
Then invertibility of Œ± proves the condition in the definition.
This is an example of a Grothendieck construction.
Define J:D‚ÜíFam(D):d‚Ü¶({*},*‚Ü¶d).
Next, note that Hom Fam(D)(Kc,Jd)‚âÖŒ£(i‚ààI(x)).Hom D(L(c,i),d).
Conversely, assume that the object part of K is given.
Then we construct a morphism part such that Œ± is natural in c.
Take œï:Hom C(c,c‚Ä≤).
This preserves the identity: K(id)=Œªi.Œ± ‚àí1(Œ∑ x,i‚àòid)=Œªi.(i,id).
Let œï:Hom C(c,c‚Ä≤) and œá:Hom C(c‚Ä≤,c‚Ä≥).
Now we prove that Œ± is natural in c.
Let œà:Hom Fam(D)(Kc‚Ä≤,Jd) and œï:Hom C(c,c‚Ä≤).

From 2009 to 2014 Andrew Stacey was the local system administrator of the nLab.
Let v,w‚ààW be two binary words of the same length n.
However, it turns out that the general case follows almost immediately from this case.
As we shall see later, this version follows almost immediately from version 1.
Note that S is the set of arrows of ùí¢: S={s‚ààS‚Ä≤|dom(s),cod(s)‚ààW 0}.
So, we define œÅ inductively by œÅ(‚àí)=0,œÅ(v‚äów)=œÅ(v)+œÅ(w)+len(w)‚àí1.
The proof is by induction on œÅ(v).
Consider two paths from v to w (n).
As above, we get in this case that dom(Œ≤‚Ä≥)=w and uÀú=u.
This completes the proof for the current case.
Proved similarly to the previous case.
W.l.o.g., we will assume 3 Œ≤.
So, we have to consider only 1 Œ≥ and 2 Œ≥.
This completes the proof of the proposition.
Still need to fill this.
The following are the highlights.
This proposition may be proved by a long and tedious induction on s‚Ä≤ and s‚Ä≥.
For example, consider: (where some associator appears in Œ≤).
So ‚Äì what am I missing here?
Hence, we must settle for equality of the interpretations in B.
Am I missing something here?
Is there an obvious one-line argument that I‚Äôm failing to see?
We can therefore assume that u 1‚â†u‚Ä≤ 1.

Following Jacob Lurie we call such a ùí¢ a geometry .

We explain what this means from right to left.
The (‚àû,1)-category Sh(ùí¢) is called an ‚àû-stack (‚àû,1)-topos.
Every ‚àû-stack (‚àû,1)-topos has a hypercompletion to one of this form.
This discussion here is glossing over all set-theoretic size issues.
The available entity closest to it is the terminal object * ùí≥‚ààùí≥.
This yields an (‚àû,1)-functor ùí™:ùí¢‚Üíùí≥.
This is canonically equipped with a (‚àû,1)-functor ùí™ SpecX:ùí¢‚ÜíSpecX.
But such concrete spaces may still be very different from the model objects in ùí¢.
for the moment this here is glossing over the difference between the two.
See geometry (for structured (‚àû,1)-toposes) for the details.

Thus we can write (1) as P(a‚Üí,b‚Üí)=‚àí‚à´dŒªœÅ(Œª)A(a‚Üí,Œª)A(b‚Üí,Œª).
Rearranging this we may write (3) as P(a‚Üí,b‚Üí)‚àíP(a‚Üí,c‚Üí)=‚àí‚à´dŒªœÅ(Œª)A(a‚Üí,Œª)A(b‚Üí,Œª)[A(b‚Üí,Œª)A(c‚Üí,Œª)‚àí1].
Suppose œÉ 1 and œÉ 2 are spins.
In theory this ought to equal P(a‚Üí,b‚Üí) but in practice it does not.
Notationally we refer to such a particle as belonging to type (a‚Üí+,b‚Üí‚àí).
There is a very important assumption implied here.
In terms of populations, we have P(a‚Üí+;b‚Üí+)=(N 3+N 4)‚àë i 8N i.
The positivity condition (9) then becomes P(a‚Üí+;b‚Üí+)‚â§P(a‚Üí+;c‚Üí+)+P(c‚Üí+;b‚Üí+).
This is Wigner‚Äôs form of Bell‚Äôs inequality.
As such, there are angles between these various axes.
From a geometric point of view, this inequality is not always possible.

A (2,1)-category is a locally groupoidal 2-category.
An (n,1)-category with the analogous properties of a topos is an (n,1)-topos.

I am a graduate student in math at the University of Washington studying algebraic geometry.
One also says that E is a fibered category over B.
Dually, in a (Grothendieck) opfibration the dependence is covariant.
Less ambiguous terms for ‚à´F are the category of elements and the oplax colimit of F.
Those fibrations corresponding to pseudofunctors that factor through Grpd are called categories fibered in groupoids.
Most frequently when considering morphisms of fibrations, the bottom arrow B‚Ä≤‚ÜíB is an identity.
The functor in the other direction is called the Grothendieck construction.
See Grothendieck construction for more details.
These two adjunctions can be turned into Quillen equivalences of model categories.
See straightening functor for more details.
This was the original application for which Grothendieck introduced the notion.
Composition is given as in the arrow category.
There is a forgetful functor ùí´:VBun‚ü∂Man which projects onto the base data.
This is of course true, and thus ùí´:VBun‚ü∂Man is a Grothendieck fibration.
Then the evident forgetful functor Mod‚ÜíRing is a fibration and an opfibration.
Then the ‚Äúcodomain‚Äù functor C 2‚ÜíC is a fibration and opfibration.
The right adjoints f * exist iff C is locally cartesian closed.
This latter property is notably difficult to even express in the language of pseudofunctors.
Every fibration or opfibration is an isofibration.
In particular, strict 2-pullbacks of fibrations are also 2-pullbacks.
Then if B is cartesian closed, so is A and p preserves the structure.
(See Hermida 99, Corollary 4.12.)
But the converse does not hold, see Section 4.3.2 of Hermida‚Äôs thesis.
A dual construction is possible if p is an opfibration.
Similarly, we can lift factorization structures for cosinks along an opfibration.
These are also called categories fibered in groupoids.
A fibration E‚ÜíB is fibered in groupoids precisely when every morphism in E is cartesian.
These are also called discrete fibrations.
These correspond to covariant pseudofunctors B‚ÜíCat.
A functor that is both a fibration and an opfibration is called a bifibration.
However E 2 is not the opposite category of E 1.
The idea of proto-fibration is closely related to this.
Interpreted in Cat we obtain the explicit notion we started with.
Such two-sided fibrations correspond to pseudofunctors A op√óB‚ÜíCat.
See two-sided fibration for more details.
There is an analog for multicategories.
See fibration of multicategories Higher categorical versions
See n-fibration for a general version.
The corresponding analog of the Grothendieck construction is discussed at (‚àû,1)-Grothendieck construction.
Here we mention a few.
Let œÄ:B‚Üìp‚ÜíB denote the projection (x,e,k)‚Ü¶x.
The following discussion brings out some interesting points about the equivalence between fibrations and pseudofunctors.
I have a (possibly stupid) question about the nature of this equivalence.
But can this really be equivalent to the fibration I started with?
Either way, it‚Äôd be great if someone could help me see the light.
Of course we are reproducing the classification of group extensions via group cohomology.

Let Y be a bornological set.
In fact, they are Banach algebras, indeed C *-algebras.
At least when X is localizable, they are in fact W *-algebras.

Nevertheless, essentially bounded functions are traditional.
DisCoCat was first introduced in Coecke, Sadrzadeh and Clark 2010.
Consider a very simple fragment of English consisting of nouns and verbs.
Write n for the type of nouns, and s for the type of sentences.
Let ùíû be the free pregroup generated by n and s.
The final ingredient we need are word vectors.
We need to pick vectors [[Alice]],[[Bob]]‚ààF(n) and [[loves]]‚ààF(n)‚äóF(s)‚äóF(n).
One should instead use a free rigid monoidal category, a kind of categorification.
Morphisms in the free autonomous category can be viewed as proof relevant grammatical reductions.
They may be encoded as string diagrams, see pregroup grammar.
This allows a slightly more elegant reformulation of our basic example.
Then grammatical computations of meaning can be performed in the product category J√óFVect.
There are multiple notions of domain of mathematics.

Thus, it is a vertical categorification of a Lie algebra.
Hence the weak equivalences are the equivariant weak homotopy equivalences.
The interval type is defined by the following rules:
An interval type is provably contractible.
An interval type is a cone type of the unit type.
An interval type is a cubical type?
The proof assumes a typal uniqueness rule for function types.

Carlo Angiuli, Univalence implies function extensionality (blog, pdf)
Let f:X‚ÜíY be a function.
We can be more specific:
The map f:X‚ÜíY is short if its Lipschitz norm is at most 1.
It is a contraction mapping? if its Lipschitz norm is strictly less than 1.
Every Lipschitz map is uniformly continuous.
Every Lipschitz map from the real line ‚Ñù to itself is absolutely continuous.
Then we may pass to the quotient metric spaces and preserve the Lipschitz norm.
I kind of get lost in all of the possibilities.

A ringoid is small Ab-enriched category.
This is sufficient for there to be a notion of kernel and cokernel in C.
In general, abelian categories are the most important examples of Ab-enriched categories.
See additive and abelian categories.
Finite products are absolute
The full argument is spelled out at additive category.
Ringoids share many of the properties of (noncommutative) rings.
Modules over a ringoid also form an abelian category and thus have a derived category.
This sort of equivalence is naturally called Morita equivalence.
See also dg-category.
The category Ab is closed monoidal and hence canonically enriched over itself.
An Ab-enriched category with one object is precisely a ring.

Any pretriangulated dg-category ùíû presents a stable (infinity,1)-category.
A plain dg-category only presents a spectrally enriched (infinity,1)-category.
The formula is just as for Lie integration of L-infinity algebroids.
There exist various model category structures which present the homotopy theory of L-‚àû algebras.
As such they carry a model structure on algebras over an operad.
All gradings in the following are ‚Ñ§-gradings, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
This appears for instance in prop. and prop. below.
This has as fibrations precisely the chain maps that are surjective in every positive degree.
This case is (currently) not discussed in the following.
This we discuss here.
But there is also a natural identification of L ‚àû-algebras with infinitesimal derived ‚àû-stacks.
For expressing this a host of other, Quillen equivalent model structures are available.
These we discuss below in Definitions as formal/infinitesimal ‚àû-stacks.
Hence in particular (F‚ä¢U) is Quillen adjunction between these model structures.
The last row points to the relevant definitions and propositions of the following text.
Here we are trying to use suggestive names of the categories involved.
Write dgLieAlg k‚ààCat for the category of dg-Lie algebras over k.
We call this the model structure on dg-Lie algebras.
Therefore ‚Ñí is also called the tangent Lie algebra functor.
On dg-coalgebras Let k be a field of characteristic 0.
(Hinich98, theorem 3.1) See also (Pridham, lemma 3.25).
We call this the model structure on dg-coalgebras.
But they form a sub-class:
In (Pridham) this is def. 1.32.
This is (Pridham, cor. 2.16).
This is (Pridham, def. 3.1) following (Manetti 02).
This is the reason for the appearance of pro-objects in def. .
This is (Pridham, prop. 4.36).
This is proven inside the proof of (Pridham, prop. 4.42).
The following proposition characterizes the structure of this category of fibrant objects.
Should spell out how this follows, using lifting.
(Pridham, prop. 4.42, see above def. 4.29)
This is (Pridham, cor. 4.49).
This is (Pridham, section 4.4).
This is (Pridham, def. 4.11, prop. 4.12).
This is (Pridham, theorem 4.26).
We discuss some further properties of the above model category structures.
The model category dgFormalSpace, def. , is a right proper model category.
This observation has been communicated privately by Jonathan Pridham
In any model category we have a notion of homotopy between 1-morphisms.
(For relation to Valette 14 see Rogers 18, below Theorem 5.9)
A useful summary of that paper is given in the notes, by Stefano Maggiolo.
Therefore, it is equivalent to a 2-category equipped with proarrows.
Moreover, the naturality of the mate correspondence yields naturality of the bijection.

With Sergey Fomin?, he created a theory of cluster algebras.
This is isomorphic to the binary dihedral group of the same order Q 8‚âÉ2D 4.
The quaternion group (of order 8) is then Dic n for n=2.
The generalised quaternion group of order 2 k+1 is Dic n with n=2 k‚àí1.
Q 8 is the multiplicative part of the quaternionic near-field J 9.
There are lots of different ways of defining Q:=Q 8.
This has a left adjoint free construction: ‚Ñ§[‚àí]:Set‚ü∂Ab.
This is the free abelian group functor.
Explicit descriptions of free abelian groups are discussed below.
For a full proof see at principal ideal domain this theorem.
Due to maximality ‚ãÉ Œª‚ààŒõV Œª is dense.
This fact implies by the countable chain condition that Œõ is countable.
Moreover it implies that each U j intersects at least one V Œª.
But this is to say that there are at most countably many U j‚Äôs.
metrisable: the topology is induced by a metric.
the topology of X is generated by a œÉ -locally discrete base.
separable: there is a countable dense subset.
Lindel√∂f: every open cover has a countable sub-cover.
countable choice: the natural numbers are a projective object in Set.
metacompact: every open cover has a point-finite open refinement.
first-countable: every point has a countable neighborhood base
second-countable spaces are Lindel√∂f.
weakly Lindel√∂f spaces with countably locally finite base are second countable.
separable metacompact spaces are Lindel√∂f.
Lindel√∂f spaces are trivially also weakly Lindel√∂f.
a first-countable space is obviously Fr√©chet-Urysohn.
a Fr√©chet-Uryson space is obviously sequential.
a sequential space is obviously countably tight.
paracompact spaces satisfying the countable chain condition are Lindel√∂f.
A map with two arguments is called bifunctorial if it is functorial in both arguments.
The term simplicial category has at least three common meanings.
The simplicial category Œî is the domain category for the presheaf category of simplicial sets.
More importantly, there are these two uses of the word:
To avoid ambiguity, simplicial objects in Cat may be called exactly that.
They may equivalently be regarded as internal categories in simplicial sets.
To avoid ambiguity, categories enriched over simplicial sets may be called simplicially enriched categories.
Of course there are close relations between these three meanings.
Unfortunately, this is not quite true.
The argument in the case of Set is given in this MO answer.
See Remark 4.4 in Master 2020
This is a limit-preserving functor between locally presentable categories.
However, it does not have a left adjoint.

The path groupoid is a groupoid internal to some category of generalized smooth spaces.

Then the smooth curves are those that compose to smooth curves under all smooth functions.

The idea is that substructures ‚Äúinherit‚Äù the property from the structure.
This general definition admits variants, some of which are described below.
(Note that subspaces are equivalent to regular subobjects in Top.)
Paracompactness is weakly hereditary.
Normality is weakly hereditary.
Induced subgraphs are equivalent to regular subobjects in the quasitopos of simple graphs.)
Examples: The property of being a forest? is hereditary.
The property of being acyclic is hereditary.
The property of being planar is hereditary.
In algebra The following examples are well-known.
In the category of modules over any commutative ring, being torsionfree is hereditary.

These are monoids in a monoidal category whose multiplicative operation is commutative.
Classical commutative monoids are of course just commutative monoids in Set with the cartesian product.
With the evident braiding this is a symmetric monoidal category.
A commutative monoid in (Ab,‚äó ‚Ñ§,‚Ñ§) is equivalently a commutative ring.
The corresponding commutative monoid objects are the differential graded-commutative algebras.

Lemma The tensor product as defined above turns Œî into a monoidal category.
To define the braiding we will need the following concepts:
These endomorphisms œÅ 0,œÉ 0 are then called spectator endomorphisms of œÅ and œÉ.
Such unitaries are called transporters.
Obviously both spectator endomorphisms and transporters are not unique, in general.
The permutators are well defined and independent of the choice of spectator endomorphisms and transporters.

A field, or a division ring, is simple.

Proposition PSh(ùíû) is a topos.
The category of presheaves PSh(ùíû) is the free cocompletion of ùíû.

Then there is an equivalence of categories PSh(‚à´ CP)‚âÉPSh(C)/P.
The inverse takes f:Q‚ÜíP to i ‚àí1(f)(A,p‚ààP(A))=f A ‚àí1(p).
In particular, this equivalence shows that slices of presheaf toposes are presheaf toposes.
Then the Artin gluing (Set D op‚ÜìT) is also a presheaf topos.
For details, see for example Appendix C.3 of Leinster.
The result is due to Carboni and Johnstone.
Hence, one has the following Proposition Let C a finite category.

So ‚Äúunramified‚Äù means ‚Äúnot branching‚Äù.
In the context of differential geometry unramified maps correspond to immersions.
A weaker (infinitesimal) version is the notion of formally unramified morphism.
The notion of unramified morphism is stable under base change and composition.
Every open immersion of schemes is formally etale hence a fortiori formally unramified.
The notion of limit and colimit generalize from category theory to (‚àû,1)-category theory.
One model for (‚àû,1)-categories are quasi-categories.
This entry discusses limits and colimits in quasi-categories.
So we also have lim‚ÜêF‚âîTerminalObj(C /F).
See HTT, prop 4.2.1.5.
The right functor is an equivalence by prop. .
This appears for instance in (Lurie, proof of prop. 1.2.13.8).
But first consider the following pointwise characterization.
This is HTT, lemma 4.2.4.3.
The morphism œï‚Ä≥ is a left fibration (using HTT, prop. 4.2.1.6)
One finds that the morphism œï‚Ä≥ is a left fibration.
This is HTT, prop. 4.4.3.2.
That this is indeed the case is asserted by the following statements.
This is HTT, theorem 4.2.4.1
Let X and Y be simplicial sets and C a quasi-category.
Let p:X ‚óÉ√óY ‚óÉ‚ÜíC be a diagram.
This is HTT, lemma 5.5.2.3
An ordinary category with limits is canonically cotensored over Set:
The following proposition should assert that this is all true
This is essentially HTT, corollary 4.4.4.9.
This justifies the following definition
See HTT, section 4.4.4.
We discuss models for (‚àû,1)-(co)limits in terms of ordinary category theory and homotopy theory.
The claim then follows from the above proposition.
Let ‚àûGrpd be the (‚àû,1)-category of ‚àû-groupoids.
Let the assumptions be as above.
The statement for the colimit is corollary 3.3.4.6 in HTT.
The statement for the limit is corollary 3.3.3.4.
See at internal (co-)limit ‚Äì Groupoidal homotopy (co-)limits for more on this.
This is HTT, corollary 3.3.4.3.
See limits and colimits by example.
The analogous statement is true for an (‚àû,1)-category of (‚àû,1)-functors.
Let D be a small quasi-category.
Proof This is HTT, corollary 5.1.2.3
If their image is a closed subspace they are called closed cofibrations.
But ‚Äúclosed cofibration‚Äù always refers to closed Hurewicz cofibrations.
Every Hurewicz cofibration i:A‚ÜíX is injective and a homeomorphism onto its image.
If X is Hausdorff, then i is closed.
The same holds in the category of all Hausdorff spaces.
But in the plain category Top of all topological spaces there are pathological counterexamples:
Then i is a non-closed cofibration.
Proposition (fiber product of Hurewicz fibrations preserves Hurewicz cofibrations)
Corollary (Cartesian product preserves Hurewicz cofibrations)
It is immediate to see that this data satisfies the conditions discussed in Prop. .
Then i is a Hurewicz cofibration iff A is itself an ANR.
But paracompact Banach manifolds are absolute neighbourhood retracts (this Prop.)
Therefore the statement follows with Prop. .
See (Ahman-Uustalu 2017, Section 6) and (Clarke 2020).
Every function A‚ÜíB yields a delta lens disc(A)‚Üídisc(B) between discrete categories.

Knot invariants are locally constant functions on this manifold.
One does not need the language of cubical complexes to define Vassiliev invariants.
Vassiliev invariants are also called finite type invariants.
Likewise, any Vassiliev invariant of degree 1 must be constant on nonsingular knots.
Conversely, one can ask which functions on chord diagrams come from finite type invariants.
Computation rules in particular are important, because they are used in inductive definitions.
Moreover, conversion rules use equality.

This stronger version further enhances to a simplicial Quillen equivalence below.
Together this implies that their composite (5) is a right Quillen functor.
We reuse the notation of the previous section.
Proof Both model categories are left proper and combinatorial.
Therefore we can take left Bousfield localizations with respect to arbitrary sets of morphisms.
Thus, we have an induced Quillen adjunction between localized model categories.
It remains to show that this Quillen adjunction is a Quillen equivalence.
It suffices to show that the right adjoint reflects weak equivalences between fibrant objects.
Local weak equivalences between locally fibrant objects coincide with objectwise weak equivalences.

Radon measures on Hausdorff spaces are regular and tight.
Regular tight Borel measures are automatically Radon.
A regular Borel measure need not be tight.
In other words, the underlying valuation of Œº is a continuous valuation.

Every œÑ-additive measure on a regular space is regular.
In particular, every œÑ-additive measure on a compact space is Radon.
Every tight œÑ-additive measure is Radon.
Every Borel measure on a separable metric space X is œÑ-additive.
Moreover, this is true if X is hereditary Lindel√∂f?.
Every œÑ-additive measure has a support, which is a closed subset.
More generally, any tight Baire measure on a Hausdorff space has a Radon extension.

Cauchy filters in all cases above have these properties:
Every Cauchy filter is proper.
The principal ultrafilter U x at any point x is Cauchy.
These conditions form the abstract definition of a Cauchy space.
Furthermore, all of these have a notion of convergence given as follows:
A filter F converges to a point x if F‚à©U x is Cauchy.
(These are the morphisms in the category of Cauchy spaces.)
So compared to the other definitions, a single A of infinitesimal diameter suffices.
A semigroup is, equivalently, a set equipped with an associative binary operation.
Nevertheless, semigroup isomorphisms must be monoid isomorphisms.

This type of semigroup is a weakly reductive semigroup.
Some mathematicians consider semigroups to be a case of centipede mathematics.
So, a semigroup can actually be seen as a monoid with extra property.
Inverse semigroups naturally occur when considering partial symmetries of an object.

Let C be a category with a terminal object 1.
The reflection of Y‚ààC is obtained by the (E,M)-factorization Y‚Üíe‚ÑìY‚Üím1.
For the nonce, let us call such a prefactorization system favorable.
Then (E,M) is a favorable prefactorization system.
The unit of this adjunction is easily seen to be an isomorphism.
Therefore, the adjunction allows us to identify reflective subcategories with certain favorable prefactorization systems.
Dualizing, it also has a coreflective closure.

The full answer to this question is of great importance for theoretical physics.

Usually X is at least a rig and often a ring or a field.
An algebraic fibrant object is a fibrant object equipped with a choice of such extensions.
Notably, AlgC is always a category of fibrant objects.
But often there are smaller subsets that still characterize all fibrant objects.
In particular, every object in AlgC is fibrant.
The Quillen adjunction (F‚ä£U) is a Quillen equivalence.
This is (Nikolaus, theorem 2.20) Remark
Thus almost any model category is equivalent to one in which all objects are fibrant.
We spell out the constructions and lemmas that yield the theorem on the model structure.
We describe explicitly the left adjoint F:C‚ÜíAlgC to the forgetful functor U:AlgC‚ÜíC.
This follows Richard Garner‚Äòs improved version of the small object argument (Garner).
For X‚ààC define a new object X ‚àû inductively as follows.
However, after adding the new fillers there may also appear new horns.
So we continue this procedure iteratively by filling these new horns.
Proceeding this way yields a sequence of acyclic cofibrations X‚ÜíX 1‚ÜíX 2‚ÜíX 3‚Üí‚ãØ.
Therefore there is a unique morphusm œï ‚àû as indicated.
The morphisms F(j):FA j‚ÜíFB j have retracts.
Take rÀú to be the (unique) filler for this morphism.
The functor U:AlgC‚ÜíC is monadic.
This is (Nikolaus, prop. 24) Proof
We check now that this choice indeed makes Q the coequalizer in AlgC.
First of all we need to check that œÄ preserves the chosen fillers.
Since œÄ coequalizes, it follows that œÄk^=œÄr^.
So it is sufficient to observe that œï Q preserves chosen fillers.
Proposition The forgetful functor U:AlgC‚ÜíC is a solid functor.
This is (Nikolaus, prop. 2.6).
Therefore we shall iteratively form colimits that equate these potentially different fillers.
But it may not yet be itself algebraically fibrant.
So we conclude by essentially applying the construction of the left adjoint F.
One checks that this has the claimed properties (‚Ä¶).
As before, the inclusion X 0 f‚ÜíX ‚àû f is an acyclic cofibration.
The universal cone morphism B j‚Üílim ‚ÜêUK provides then a distinguished filler for the limit.
Now consider filtered colimits.
By assumption the domains A j are small objects.
This provides a filler B j‚ÜíK i‚ÜíL.
This makes L an object in AlgC.
By the same argument one finds that it is the universal cocone under K in AlgC.
This is (Nikolaus, prop 2.14).
By adjunction (F‚ä£U) this corresponds to an adjunct gÀú 2:FB‚ÜíZ.
This establishes the pushout property of (B‚àê AUY) ‚àû f.
Hence so is the composite of the two.
This appears as (Nikolaus, def. 2.15).
We spell out the argument, following (Nikolaus).
The first item is true by the above discussion of filtered colimits in AlgC.
The functor U preserves acyclic cofibrations.
Theorem The Quillen adjunction (F‚ä£U):AlgC‚ÜíU‚ÜêFC is a Quillen equivalence.
Hence by 2-out-of-3 also X‚ÜíFX is a weak equivalence.
Proposition If C is a locally presentable category then so is AlgC.
If C is a combinatorial model category then so is AlgC.
This means precisely that all possible composites and all possible inverses are chosen.
Daniel Waldram is professor for theoretical physics at Imperial College London.
An interesting counterexample is given for instance by Dugger & Shipley (2009).
Here are further characterizations:
But p R(c) is a weak equivalence by definition of cofibrant replacement.
And every equivalence between these is presented by a Zig-Zag of Quillen equivalences.

A (total) function is precisely a relation that is both functional and entire.

Suppose r(x,y).
Thus s(y‚Ä≤,x) and r(x,y); from sr‚â§1 Y we infer y‚Ä≤=y.
We conclude at most one y satisfies r(x,y), making r functional.
So the monad t is an equivalence relation.
These are instead described by the AdS/CFT correspondence in condensed matter physics.

Judgmental uniqueness of identity proofs holds in XTT, where it follows from boundary separation.
In this section we assume that the universe is a Tarski universe.
For noncommutative rings however sometimes spectra of primitive ideal?s are more interesting.
(Note the similarity with the strict notion of equivalence of categories.)
Being homotopy equivalent is evidently an equivalence relation.
For many purposes, one wants instead weak homotopy equivalences.
The homotopy category of Top with respect to homotopy equivalences is Ho(Top) he.
Any homotopy equivalence is also a weak homotopy equivalence.
This is the Whitehead theorem.
Sometimes an apparently stronger form of homotopy equivalence is needed.
Let us set this up slightly differently:
In the usual definition of homotopy equivalence, there is no coherence required between these.
That is handled precisely by the notion of strong homotopy equivalence.
The definition clearly can be generalised to any reasonable setting with a notion of homotopy.
The question naturally arises as to whether all homotopy equivalences are strong.
Various versions of this are known in other settings, e.g. SSet-enriched categories.
There is no condition of compatibilty between the two ‚Äòhomotopies between the homotopies‚Äô.
Every second countable locally compact Hausdorff space is a Polish space, among others.
Polish spaces provide a useful framework for doing measure theory.
Why are Polish spaces ‚Äònot very big‚Äô?
In other words, why are there none with cardinality exceeding the continuum?
More sharply, see Lemma below.
See also Theorem below.
The metric topology on X coincides with the product topology.
In particular, the Hilbert cube [0,1] ‚Ñï is Polish.
See Marker, Theorem 1.33.
Proposition Any Polish space is homeomorphic to a subspace of the Hilbert cube.
admits a continuous surjection from Baire space.
One may check that f is continuous and surjective.
Let C‚äÜX be a closed subset of a Polish space X.
This ordinal is called the Cantor-Bendixson rank of C.
A perfect set is a closed set C such that C=C‚Ä≤.
In particular, the cardinality of P is the continuum c.
The complement C‚àñC Œ± is at most countable.
In particular, any two denumerable Polish spaces are Borel isomorphic.
The unit interval [0,1] and Cantor space 2 ‚Ñï are Borel isomorphic.
Let E‚äÜ2 ‚Ñï be the set of (0,1)-sequences that are eventually constant.
Pick any bijection g:E‚Üí{dyadicrationals}.
Then the union of f and g defines a Borel isomorphism h:2 ‚Ñï‚Üí[0,1].
We show that any such X is Borel isomorphic to Cantor space.
For another proof, see theorem 3.1.1 of Berberian.
The classical L p-spaces for p<‚àû are Polish spaces.
If X is a separable complete metric space, then so is K(X).
A locally compact Hausdorff space is Polish iff it is second-countable.
(See for example A.10 here.)
Internal groupoids in Polish spaces are considered in

(Or so I imagine; this definition might not really be general enough.)
However, the explicit exposition of this interpretation seems to have come rather late.

Then the G-fixed locus X G‚Ü™X is a smooth submanifold.
Smooth mapping spaces are very nice examples of infinite dimensional smooth manifolds.
This provides a route from finite dimensional differential topology to that of infinite dimensions.
An example of this is the concept of a tubular neighbourhood of an embedding.
We define the neighbourhood of Œ©M to be those loops Œ±‚ààLM such that Œ±(1)‚ààU.
However, that just moves Œ±(1).
We cannot assume that all of Œ± lies in U.
Then we can define œÄ(Œ±)=Œ®‚àòŒ±.
The trick is to choose Œ® so that it varies smoothly with Œ±(1).
There are more complicated examples.
One such is the basic construction in string topology.
Thus local solutions are not applicable here.
One way to choose these diffeomorphisms is to use the notion of a propagating flow.
The basic idea is contained in the following definition.
Everything here is assumed to be finite dimensional.
But the diffeomorphisms used here are simple enough that they can be constructed directly.
Let us consider the linear situation first.
This is simple enough: œï 1(w)=w‚àív.
The problem with this is that we do not want just any diffeomorphism.
We want one that is the identity ‚Äúnear infinity‚Äù.
Let us start by fixing the diffeomorphism in the v-direction.
We are actually interested in the function t‚Ü¶t+hœÉ(t) for |h|‚â§1.
On V, we choose a ‚Äúdual functional‚Äù to v.
Then we define a diffeomorphism on V by: œï 2(w)=w+œÉ(f(w))v=(w‚àíf(w)v)+(f(w)+œÉ(f(w)))v.
This fixes our diffeomorphism in the v-direction.
Then we mix this in to the above as follows: œï 3(w)=w+œÑ^(w‚àíf(w)v)œÉ(f(w))v=(w‚àíf(w)v)+(f(w)+œÑ^(w‚àíf(w)v)œÉ(f(w))v.
As before, the second expression makes it clear that this is a diffeomorphism.
When œÑ^(w‚àíf(w)v)=0 then it is the identity.
To simplify these, we assume that V admits a smooth inner product, g.
Let us write q for the square of the associated norm.
To make the final formula cleaner, we assume that œÑ(t)=1 for |t|‚â§2.
As written, this makes sense only for v‚â†0.
But it extends to the identity at v=0.
This, then, is our required linear diffeomorphism.
The next step is to extend this to a bundle over a manifold.
So let œÄ:E‚ÜíM be a smooth vector bundle over a smooth manifold.
We wish to extend the above formula so that it is valid for E.
So also we must take w to be an arbitrary point in E.
The solution is to extend one of them to a vector field.
Notice that X v(p)=0 if p is ‚Äúsufficiently far‚Äù from œÄ(v).

We discuss existence and characterization of (co)limits in a Grothendieck construction.
then ‚à´F is complete.
Dually, if C is cocomplete.
Explicitly, colimits in ‚à´ ùí≥C ùí≥ are computed as follows:
This clearly makes Œ± c a functor.
Hence we have shown that the above equivalence holds.
(These are in fact the opcartesian morphisms with respect to the projection ‚à´F‚ÜíC.)
Compositions are those induced from the underlying functors and natural transformations.
There is refinement of the Grothendieck construction to model categories.
See at Grothendieck construction for model categories.
Notice that much of the traditional literature discusses (just) the right adjoint.
This functor may equivalently be expressed as follows.
This also facilitates the generalization of the argument from 1-categories to higher categories.
This is just as in the comma category c/p.
This is due to (Thomason 79).
For more details see (‚àû,1)-Grothendieck construction Normal lax functors into Prof
The Grothendieck construction can be generalized from pseudofunctors into Cat to normal lax functors into Prof.
Instead of fibrations over C, such normal lax functors correspond to arbitrary functors into C.
See displayed category for more.
This constructs an Abelian group from the semi-group of isomorphism classes.
The corresponding fibrations C/X‚ÜíC are also called representable fibered categories.
This follows readily by unwinding the definitions.
This is often the default meaning of the term codomain fibration.
By dilatino one refers to a superpartner of the dilaton.
In supergravity literature there is an ambiguity in the nomenclature relatively to the dilatino field.

But then one must ask, is this really a space?
In other words, is it representable?

Œõ will denote a complete noetherian ring.
A small thickening is a thickening in which I is principal.
The functor F^: ŒõNoeth k‚ÜíSet is defined to be F^(A)=lim nF(R/ùî™ n).
A predeformation functor is prorepresentable if F^ is representable.
Call this map (*).
Geometrically the conditions can informally be thought of as follows:
One can think of (H1) as being able to ‚Äúglue‚Äù.
One can think of (H2) as gluing being unique over infinitesimal neighborhoods.
(H3) is having a finite dimensional tangent space
Here we make precise what was meant in the motivation section.
This F can be seen to be a deformation functor.
Let Def X be the predeformation functor parametrizing flat deformations of X.
Def X is prorepresentable if and only if every automorphism extends over a small thickening.
Consider the node X=Speck[[x,y]]/(xy).
Note that this functor is not prorepresentable.
Several more can be added.
I haven‚Äôt come up with a nice succinct way to do this yet.
Let f:X‚ÜíSpecA be proper and A complete, local, noetherian ring.

This article is about generalized Lawvere theories.
The free algebra on one generator becomes the generic object.
The exponent n serves to keep track of arities of operations.
Lawvere‚Äôs program can be extended to cover many theories with infinitary operations as well.
These examples go outside the bounded (small theory) case.
An example is the theory of complete Boolean algebras.
Lawvere theories can also be generalized to handle multi-sorted operations.
For the moment we discuss the single-sorted case.
The many-sorted case should be a straightforward extension.
Algebraic theories can be extended or specialized in various directions.
Here are a few variations on the theme.
Essentially algebraic theories allow for partially-defined operations.
Let S be a set whose elements are called sorts.
Clearly, (Set/S) op has small products.
A homomorphism of models is simply a natural transformation between product-preserving functors.
These form an important subclass.
(Under this relation ordinary finitary Lawvere theories correspond to finitary monads.)
Then the Lawvere theory of the monad of C is equivalent to C.
This functor is an equivalence.
It is convenient to proceed as follows.
Let f:X‚ÜíY be a morphism of Prod(Kl(T) op,Set).
Thus A is an equivalence, with essential inverse M. Metaphor
Ring theory is a branch of mathematics with a well-developed terminology.
We may call such an algebraic theory annular.
The pun model/module is due to Jon Beck.
But later Jordan algebras have been studied largely for their own sake.
See at Bohr topos and poset of commutative subalgebras for more on this.
Such Jordan algebras are called special Jordan algebras; all others are called exceptional.
Jordan algebras had their origin in the study of the foundations of quantum theory.
(Note that ‚Ñù, ‚ÑÇ, ‚Ñç and ùïÜ are all *-algebras.)
The 3√ó3 self-adjoint octonionic matrices form the Albert algebra.
Jordan algebras in the fifth family are called spin factors.
This family has some overlaps with the others.

Consider first the case of ordinary quantum theory.
The map sending observables to their expectation values is real-linear.
All of this generalizes to an arbitrary finite-dimensional formally real Jordan algebra J.

A topological space is separable if it has a countable dense subset.
Subspaces of separable spaces need not be separable.
However, open subspaces of separable spaces are separable.
Many results in analysis are easiest for separable spaces.
A classical fact is Theorem

Every second-countable topological space is separable.
Properties second-countable: there is a countable base of the topology.
metrisable: the topology is induced by a metric.
separable: there is a countable dense subset.
Lindel√∂f: every open cover has a countable sub-cover.
metacompact: every open cover has a point-finite open refinement.
first-countable: every point has a countable neighborhood base
a metric space has a œÉ -locally discrete base
second-countable spaces are Lindel√∂f.
weakly Lindel√∂f spaces with countably locally finite base are second countable.
separable metacompact spaces are Lindel√∂f.
Lindel√∂f spaces are trivially also weakly Lindel√∂f.

Before describing proof nets, we start with Girard‚Äôs notion of proof structure.
We need just a few preliminaries.
(Negation may be defined by ¬¨A‚âîA‚ä∏‚ä•, and the multiplicative disjunction by A‚ÖãB‚âî¬¨A‚ä∏B.
To get formulas in MILL, simply drop ‚ä•.)
The construction of a formula may be displayed as a binary planar tree.
These KM-links give a KM-graph.
MLL formulas A and proof structures of type A‚ÜíB form a category Struct[T].
In fact this category of proof structures is a *-autonomous category.
Observe that the objects of F[T] may be identified with MLL formulas.
The rules for forming KM-graphs will sound pretty repetitive!
But don‚Äôt worry; that just means they‚Äôre really easy.
There are four of these.
We give this criterion below.
The proof of existence is by a tricky combinatorial analysis on graphs.
This leaves the two unit rules 1 ‚àí, ‚ä• +.
The Danos-Regnier criterion for validity goes through without modification:

The category Top of topological spaces lacks many good categorical properties.
It is a coreflective subcategory of a reflective subcategory of Top.
Homotopy theorists often find the category of simplicial sets to be an especially nice environment.

In particular, PsTop is locally cartesian closed (but not locally presentable).
The category of compact Hausdorff spaces is perfectly nice for some purposes.

This is an example of the microcosm principle.
On the other hand, this is not always true.
An associative operation/magma/algebra is both alternative and flexible.

Relations between gauge fields and strings present an old, fascinating and unanswered question.
The full answer to this question is of great importance for theoretical physics.
Moreover, in the SU(N) gauge theory the strings interaction is weak at large N.
The challenge is to build a precise theory on the string side of this duality.
This is, however, very different from the picture of strings as flux lines.
Interestingly, even now people often don‚Äôt distinguish between these approaches.
However there are cases in which t‚ÄôHooft‚Äôs mechanism is really working.
These are equations of central interest in number theory.
Due to this subtlety, it is instructive to make explicit the following definition:
See also Demailly 2012, Lem. IV 6.9.
Here is another proof of Prop. : Proof
A nonempty intersection of finitely many such geodesically convex neighborhoods is also geodesically convex.
By definition of geodesic convexity the exponential map is injective, hence a diffeomorphism.
The same holds true for full subcategories such as CartSp‚Äì Cartesian spaces.
It is sufficient to check this in ParaSmMfd.
Hopefully someone can find a clear reference to a proof.
It is also evidently a split hypercover.
This implies the statement by the characterization of cofibrant objects in the projective structure.
This has a useful application in the nerve theorem.

The following conditions on a category C are equivalent.
When they are satisfied, we say that C is adhesive.
In other words, pushouts of monomorphisms are van Kampen colimits.
In an adhesive category, however, they are: Proposition
Then: n is also a monomorphism.
The square is also a pullback square.
The following proposition is crucial in double pushout graph rewriting.
We give only a sketch; details are in (LS, Lemma 4.5).
Denote the vertex of the latter pullback square by U.
Example Any topos is adhesive (Lack-Sobocisnki).
For elementary toposes it is a theorem of Lack and Sobocinski.

We may think of the action groupoid as a resolution of the usual quotient.
The action groupoid also goes by other names, including ‚Äòweak quotient‚Äô.

It is also called a ‚Äúsemidirect product‚Äù and then written S‚ãäG.
So, a general morphism is a pair (g,s):s‚Üígs.
The colimit colimX√ó G 0 √ó ‚Ä¢ is called action ‚àû-groupoid of G on X.
This functor sends the single object of BG to the set S.

The action groupoids X//G of a group G come equipped with a canonical map to BG‚âÉ*//G.
Let G be an ‚àû-group in that BG is an ‚àû-groupoid with a single object.
This takes the single object of BG to some (‚àû,1)-category V.

Of course the category Vect has some special properties.
This is traditionally captured by the following terminology for additive and abelian categories.
Let ùíû be a category.
We write V‚äïW for the direct sum of two objects of ùíû.
Recall the basic construction of the tensor product of vector spaces:
As expected, we have the following basic example: Example
This defines a category, denoted Vect G.
Let (ùíû,‚äó,1) be a monoidal category, def. .
A key such property is commutativity.
We will see below that this is the very source of superalgebra.
As in example , this definition makes ‚Ñ§/2 a monoidal category def. .
(See at looping and delooping).
We write k 1|0 and k 0|1 for these, respectively.

This is a special and limiting case of the relativistic particle discussed below.
A cautionary note is in order.
The œÉ-model describing the relativistic particle is the following.
Its curvature exterior derivative F:=dA is the field strength of an electromagnetic field on X.
First regard the case that the background field strength vanishes, F=0.
Then the equations of motion reduce to ‚àá Œ≥ÀôŒ≥Àô=0.
These curves are precisely the geodesics of the background geometry.
This models motion under the force exerted by the field of gravity on our particle.
For these the equations of motions are again those of the free Newtonian particle a‚Üí=0.
This is called the action functional of the relativistic particle œÉ-model.
This usually yields a simpler and deeper description of the model.
Aspects of this are discussed below.
let configuration space be the weak quotient Conf Œ£:=C ‚àû(Œ£,X)//Diff(Œ£).
Its 3-form curvature field strength is traditionally denoted H:=dB.
Hence the string behaves as if electric charge is spread out evenly along it.
(For more on this see string theory.)
Equivalently this is a U(1)-bundle gerbe with connection.
One can consider the string œÉ-model for worldsheets with boundary.
Such a background gauge field structure is called a string orientifold background.
This is a kind of higher structure that the relativistic particle alone cannot see.
This is discussed in detail at differential string structure
However some permutations fix k+1 without being an element of this subgroup.

makes precise what this means in higher geometry.
The quantomorphism group is naturally an (infinite dimensional) Lie group.
Its Lie algebra is the Poisson bracket Lie algebra.
Such autoequivalences in slices are familiar from basic concepts of Lie groupoid theory.
This collection of data is known as a bisection of a Lie groupoid.
Before we get there, notice the following‚Ä¶
Therefore we want to lift the above table of traditional notions to higher geometry‚Ä¶
In order to say this, clearly we need some basics of higher geometry‚Ä¶
The inverse equivalence B is the delooping operation.
The others are obtained by succesively forgetting connection data.
The extension sequence is then schematically simply the following
Let H be an (‚àû,1)-topos.
Let G‚ààGrp(H) be a group object in H, an ‚àû-group.
This is discussed at principal ‚àû-bundle.
Using these two facts we now set:
To this end we need the following two definitions
For an example see at The quantomorphism n-group below.
Let H be an (‚àû,1)-topos which is cohesive.
We first show how the general notion of higher Atiyah groupoid reproduces various traditonal structures.
This is precisely the smooth manifold of morphisms of the traditional Atiyah Lie groupoid.
We discuss here how this is the Lie differentiation of the corresponding higher Atiyah groupoid.
This is a direct consequence of the discussion at circle n-bundle with connection.
The morphisms are accordingly the suitable natural transformations of these diagrams.
With this identification the main result there is the above claim.
Let ùîæonGrpd(H) be equipped with the structure of a braided ‚àû-group.
By remark we want to pass to its concretification.
Therefore the following definition states the above pullback diagram with that replacement.
This is the corresponding Heisenberg ‚àû-group.
Consider now the higher prequantum geometry of this 2-connection.
Therefore by prop. we have an ‚àû-group extension BU(1)‚ÜíHeis(‚àá)‚ÜíG.
The latter captures some but not all of the information about I T.
If it is a commutative monoid, it is an E-‚àû ring.

This intrinsic randomness in quantum physics is referred to as quantum fluctuation.
(See also at measurement problem.)
In particular the above holds for the vacuum state of any quantum system.
These are therefore also called vacuum fluctuations.
We start by constructing the free category with small products generated by a set S.
This can also be regarded as a Yoneda embedding under the equivalence Set/S‚âÉSet S.
Therefore the following theorem comes as no surprise.
Let C be a category with small products.
In particular, it preserves all limits, not just products.
Let C be a small category.
The proof of the universal property of Coprod(C) as coproduct cocompletion is then obvious.
First, we have a Yoneda mapping C 0‚ÜíSet C op:c‚Ü¶hom(‚àí,c)
By the preceding theorem, this functor has a right adjoint.
The reflection takes an object f:X‚ÜíY to the pair (Im(f),Y).
In particular, Subset is complete and cocomplete and cartesian closed.
As are exponentials, since Subset is actually an exponential ideal in Set 2 op.
Categories enriched in Subset are also called M-categories.
The hom-sets are clearly small.
We denote this free category with products as Term(S,F).
Composition is effected by term substitution.
This trick effectively eliminates the need for rules of Œ±-conversion.
To begin, recall the following abstract definition:
:MM‚ÜíM is the multiplication on the monad M.
A monad on S in the bicategory M-Span is a multicategory over S.
We are especially interested in the free multicategory generated from a multigraph over S.
The free multicategory construction has other names and descriptions.
Notice that F-labeled trees have obvious string diagram representations.
Next, any multicategory generates a (strict monoidal) category.
The objects of Pro(S,F) are elements of S *.
The same trick works for other doctrines over the doctrine of monoidal categories.
Therefore Pro(S,F) is the free monoidal category generated by the multigraph F.
This gives a morphism between underlying spans, Term(S,F)‚ÜíC.
(This equivalence is discussed in detail below.)
In particular, such pullbacks preserve all colimits.
This pullback now manifestly computes ùíû /X(f *‚ü®F‚ÜíY‚ü©,‚ü®E‚ÜípX‚ü©).
Let œï:A‚ÜíX be any morphism.
This proves that X√ó‚àí:C‚ÜíC/x preserves exponentials.
By Giraud's theorem, in a sheaf topos pullbacks preserve colimits.
By prop. this yields the local cartesian closure.
More generally, every quasitopos is locally cartesian closed.
For example, the strong nuclear force is mediated by gluons.
But such quantum systems are far from classical mechanical systems.

The vertex operator algebras corresponding to the WZW model are current algebras.
This immediately raises the question for natural classes of examples of such prequantizations.
The prequantum n-bundles arising this way are the higher WZW terms discussed here.

This entry contains a basic introduction to derived group schemes and their orientations.
This requires derived algebraic geometry.
We would like extend this definition to the world of derived schemes.
Because of the higher categorical nature of derived schemes Hom sets are spaces.
Everything should in the ‚àû-setting, that is defined only up to homotopy.
The following definition is somewhat restrictive and really should incorporate more of the ‚àû-structure.
Let X be a scheme, then we have an associated derived scheme X¬Ø.
Hence we are led to the following definition.
Let X be a derived scheme and G a commutative derived group scheme over X.
A preorientation of G is a morphism of topological commutative monoids ‚Ñô(‚ÑÇ[Œ±])=‚ÑÇP ‚àû‚ÜíG(X).
Notice that ‚ÑÇP ‚àû is nearly freely generated.
We would like to encode this in our derived language (without defining s‚Ä≤).
Note that (2) implies that A is weakly periodic.
We now define the module œâ and the map Œ≤.
Let Œ© denote the sheaf of differentials on G 0/œÄ 0A.
Then SpecR[M] is a group scheme over SpecA.
Motivated by these observations we make the following definitions.
Let A be an E ‚àû-ring.
We define the multiplicative group corresponding to A as G m=SpecA[‚Ñ§].
G m is a derived commutative group scheme over SpecA.
Note that œÄ *(A[‚Ñ§])=(œÄ *A)[‚Ñ§].
Also, the map œÄ 0G m‚ÜíœÄ 0SpecA is smooth of relative dimension 1.
Corollary SpecS[‚ÑÇP ‚àû] is the moduli space of preorientations of G m.
Let Œ≤ denote the (universal) orientation of S[‚ÑÇP ‚àû].
Then we have the following.
Theorem SpecS[‚ÑÇP ‚àû][Œ≤ ‚àí1] is the moduli space of orientations of G m.
Let A be an E ‚àû-ring, so in particular A defines a cohomology theory.
Also, A 1 is not commutative.
A 1(A) is an infinite loop space, but not an Abelian monoid.
Again A 1 is a derived group scheme when restricted to rational E ‚àû-rings.
Note that in this category H‚Ñ§ is initial.
Why can‚Äôt we just use SpecA[‚Ñï]?
Consequently, SpecH‚Ñ§[‚ÑÇP ‚àû] is the moduli space of preorientations of G a.
Proposition SpecH‚Ñ§[‚ÑÇP ‚àû][Œ≤ ‚àí1] is the moduli space of orientations of G a.
Hence the Chern character yields an isomorphism with rational periodic cohomology.
The quotient of that by the binary icosahedral group is the Poincar√© homology sphere.
Proposition The topological space underlying a scheme is a sober topological space.
For proof see this prop at Zariski topology.
Often one treats such iÀú as an identity map.
Let X,Y be simplicial complexes, and let f:|X|‚Üí|Y| be a continuous map.

In particular, they must be invariant under weak equivalence.
Many, perhaps most, presentations of (‚àû,1)-categories are model categories.
In fact, every morphism is weakly equivalent to a fibration and to a cofibration.
Dually we have acyclic or trivial cofibrations.
All morphisms are both fibrations and cofibrations.
The (‚àû,1)-category presented is again the 1-category Set.
The acyclic fibrations are the equivalences of categories which are literally surjective on objects.
Every object is both fibrant and cofibrant.
The (‚àû,1)-category presented is the 2-category Cat.
This is often called the folk model structure.
The (‚àû,1)-category presented is the (weak) 3-category 2Cat.
This model structure is due to Steve Lack.

The question is as to whether these have any relation to each other.

I think it was a very wise remark.
In this generalized sense, functions between sets are the morphisms in the category Set.
This is cartesian closed, and the function type S‚ÜíT is then the function set.
The formal definition of a function depends on the foundations chosen.
The first and fifth definitions are interdefinable by the following
Such technical hacks can be avoided by choosing a different foundations.
But usually the algebraic structure is fixed to be the one of a vector space.

Technically, these are diagrams in some locally cartesian closed (model) category.
‚Äì An identification identifies itself with a self-identification.
Cubical identity types essentially turns this equality itself into a typal equality.
Similarly, higher observational type theory has its appropriate version of higher identity types.
Martin-L√∂f identity types come in both strict and weak flavours.
We will discuss both formulations.
To a category theorist, it might be more natural to call this 1 X.
This can be made precise with the identity type weak factorization system?.
Finally, we have the ‚Äúcomputation‚Äù or Œ≤-reduction? rule.
This says that if we substitute along a reflexivity proof, nothing happens.
See, for instance, Overture.v
This Œ∑-conversion rule has some very strong consequences.
(This was observed already in (Streicher).)
However, it does not have global elimination or computation rules.
Instead, it has a local computation rule for each particular type.
We are working in a dependent type theory with Tarski-style universes.
Thus, ap is a higher dimensional explicit substitution.
The primary identity types are the nondependent cubical path types in cubical type theory.
See cubical path type for more information on the construction of the cubical path types.
There are four obstacles in the way of such a construction.
However, every construction in type theory is stable under substitution.
This imposes an additional coherence requirement which is tricky to obtain categorically.
See categorical model of dependent types.
For more see the references at homotopy type theory.
The explicit realization reviewed below is due to (Sen 97).
For any other choice of path the surface area will be larger.
The type IIA limit is given by m‚Üí0.
The type IIA image of the origin of this configuration is an orientifold plane.
Takeuchi product is used in the theory of associative bialgebroids over noncommutative base.
This article documents the differences between versions zero and one of CompLF.
Note that there‚Äôs a substitution baked into the Œ† codomain rule.
This is because substitution is still an admissible rule.
Not baking in a substitution here would probably mess that up.
In v1, it‚Äôs actually revealing additional facts about the interpretation of the judgments.
no longer requires the new type to be proven valid as an extra premise.
Prove symmetry in the usual way, and combine with select left.
(Maybe it was already redundant before, who knows?)
In v1, this premise is removed.
Similarly, the PER elimination rule had the motive validity premise removed.
Yet another, the Bool elimination rule had the motive validity premise removed.
Luckily, a family over the booleans only has two substitution instances, semantically.
But this seems to require identity, a different v1 addition.)
Another important change is the new equality formation rule.
Here is the v0 rule: Œì‚ä¢p‚ä©A‚â∫CŒì‚ä¢q‚ä©B‚â∫CŒì‚ä¢a‚ä©AŒì‚ä¢b‚ä©BŒì‚ä¢a=b‚ààCtype
Here is the v1 rule: Œì‚ä¢a1‚ä©Relax(A)Œì‚ä¢a2‚ä©Relax(A)Œì‚ä¢a1=a2‚ààAtype
But that is not the main improvement.
One could just make respect into a primitive type constructor to avoid the circularity.
With relaxed equality, the inversion rules are rather obvious.
This is a corollary of that subtyping characterization of Relax.
There‚Äôs another way to think about Relax.
Every type is a subquotient of Comp.
So what happens if you decompose some arbitrary type A in these ways?
It‚Äôs (Comp‚à©A), the type of computations that are also elements of A.
It turns out that the other decomposition is not unique.
(Except Nuprl calls it Base instead of Comp.)
And that type is the least quotient of Comp of which A is a subset!
The additional element can be regarded as an undefined element.
But for elements of Relax(A), it‚Äôs strict in both senses.
But that means they‚Äôre elements of Relax(A), because Relax is idempotent.
All of this is provable internally, using the rules for Relax and equality.
(In general, this shortcut does not avoid congruence rules for binding forms.)
Plus it‚Äôs not reflexive, symmetric, or transitive.
Let‚Äôs call that (‚Üî Œ≤).
It turns out to be the same as (‚â° Œ≤).
What we seem to be missing is most of the congruence rules.
So we effectively have all the congruence rules.
In v0, quotienting was almost completely broken.
In v1, letcomp is what makes it work.
But it‚Äôs not perfect.
Rules that involve metavariables without an associated typing premise tend to cause trouble.
Alas, it seems very difficult to do much about that.
So the ability to derive type constructors and their rules seems quite substantial already.
There was actually an early version of letcomp for v0.
CompLF v1 adds a type Nat of Scott-encoded natural numbers.
The Scott nats themselves are not new, of course.
The motive premise cannot be avoided in the Nat elimination rule.
But another reason has to do with technical details of PER semantics.
Nuprl‚Äôs version of induction actually does avoid the motive premise.
(Nuprl‚Äôs logic is much stronger than Peano arithmetic, by the way.)
But CompLF must pursue alternatives.
(TODO: Explain!)
Identity types provide another kind of equality type that also provides subsumptive rewriting.
Only when dealing with computations is it safe to assume identity.
But in that case, it coincides with equality.
In fact, identity is equality of computations, in the semantics.
The different rules are due entirely to the difference in when the types are valid.
This is why identity has no inversion rules.
Meanwhile, (t=t‚ààComp) is not true or even meaningful unless t‚ààComp.
That‚Äôs exactly what it is, semantically.
Nuprl has additional features that facilitate internal reasoning about computational equivalence.
But in v1, identity seems scarcely different from beta conversion in practice.
(So the change doesn‚Äôt help or hurt.)
So now reflexivity is derived from uniqueness and select left.
There‚Äôs been some reordering of rules, premises, and renaming of metavariables.
Therefore, any subcategory is contained in a smallest replete subcategory, called its repletion.
In particular, in this case, the repletion is equivalent to D.
Thus the inclusion D‚Ü™repl(D) is full.
It is clearly faithful and essentially surjective, so it is an equivalence.
The replete image of a functor is the repletion of its image.
Then replete subcategories of 1-categories are those which are replete in this sense.

Epsilontic analysis developed out of the practical problems of finding errors of approximation.

It follows from the above that ‚Äñv‚Äñ‚â•0; in particular, ‚Äñ0‚Äñ=0.
A norm is a pseudonorm that satisfies a converse to this: v=0 if ‚Äñv‚Äñ=0.
Then a Banach space is simply a vector space equipped with a complete norm.
(In other words, it is only a G-pseudonorm.)
Thus pseudonorms correspond precisely to homogeneous translation-invariant pseudometrics.
In this case, we say that f is bounded.
There are many (nonequivalent) ways to do so.
In this case one can accept all bounded linear maps between Banach spaces as morphisms.

Many examples of Banach spaces are parametrised by an exponent 1‚â§p‚â§‚àû.

thanks to Toby for the rephrasing, it‚Äôs much better now, yes
I have rolled back now, but that, too, involved some funny effects.
Am hoping to eventually expand and polish this entry.
However, whinging on this page is pretty pointless.
Treat it as a lab elf notice board.
There are various sub-departments, all with different roles and skills.)
And yes, we are all suffering from the slowness of the Lab.
To Jon Awbrey: I may have some solutions for you at the Sandbox.
Then Recently Revised will be able to return as well.

Neither is there a direct link to this page.
And is not recently revised?
That also means we‚Äôre not likely to work on further developing your articles.
The first thing I do when visiting the nLab is go to this page‚Ä¶

OK, this is a good reason.
But nLab is still too slow!
Is nobody using recently revised??
Edited Zoran's latest additions.
Replied to Zoran at topological vector space.

The following text is copied from MO/4246/4258 by Denis-Charles Cisinski:
In particular a Morita morphism which is a homotopy equivalence is a Morita equivalence.
This may be regarded as the point particle limit of stringy weight systems.
The monad induced from an ambidextrous adjunction is Frobenius.
The converse is also true:
X is T 0 if and only if its specialisation order is a partial order.
X is T 1 iff its specialisation order is equality.
(See separation axioms.)
This topology is called the specialization topology.
Hence the category of prosets is equivalent to the category of Alexandroff spaces.
In type theory the empty type is the type with no term.
In set theory, it is an empty set.
The empty type can be represented as a univalent universe.
We inductively define the type family x:ùüò‚ä¢El ùüò(x)type by defining El ùüò(*)‚âîùüò
Thus, the univalence axiom is trivially true.
(see also Cook-Crabb 93)
The octonionic Hopf fibration does not admit any S 1 subfibration?
It is also strongly connected, since finite products are also finite limits.
Totally connected geometric morphisms are closed under composition and stable under pullback.
Hence the topos of sheaves on any totally connected site is totally connected.
Vassily Gorbounov is a professor of mathematics at Aberdeen.
Every quasi-category is equivalent to a minimal quasi-category.
An (‚àû,1)-category C is called minimal (‚àû,1)-category if C‚Üí* is minimal.

Let X be a Kan complex.
To be self-contained, we recall the relevant definitions here.
See Remark below for comparison of notation used here to notation used elsewhere.
Let X be a manifold, possibly with boundary.
More generally, let Y be another manifold, possibly with boundary.
First recall the following equivalence already before stabilization:
Probably p 1 coincides with that canonical morphism, up to equivalence.
Abraham Fraenkel was a mathematician who worked on set theory and foundations.
A top element ‚ä§ is one for wich a‚â§‚ä§.
An ordinal is the equivalence class of a well-order.
A limit ordinal is one that is not a successor.
Here (n+1) is the successor of n.

The remaining exactness properties still permit a considerable amount of homological algebra.
ùíû has kernels and cokernels.
every mono is a kernel and every epi is a cokernel.
every morphism has an epi-mono factorization.
Their homological algebra was studied by Mitchell (1965).
Grandis worked on further generalizations that he called semi-exact or homological.
An entire relation is sometimes called ‚Äòtotal‚Äô, but these are unrelated concepts.
A total relation is necessarily reflexive.
For an irreflexive version, see connected relation.
(Of course, this containment is in fact an equality.)
(Here, Œî A is the equality relation on the set A.)
Totality is antithetical to asymmetry.
We let œÄ:U‚àòCof‚Üí1 Vect denote the counit of the adjunction U‚ä£Cof.
The law of a deterministic random variable is a Dirac measure.
We consider only simply sorted set theories, which all have membership relations.
Nor is having a heterogeneous membership relation sufficient for defining structural set theories.

Overlap algebras are one possible constructive version of complete Boolean algebras.

It turns out that it is useful to consider colimit preserving functors.
This is Lurie, def. 5.5.3.1.
More on that is at symmetric monoidal (‚àû,1)-category of presentable (‚àû,1)-categories.

Let f:ùíû‚Üíùíü be an (‚àû,1)-functor which exhibits ùíü as an idempotent completion ùíû.
Let Œ∫ be a regular cardinal.
This is (Lurie, lemma 5.5.1.3).
If R preserves Œ∫-filtered (‚àû,1)-colimits then L preserves Œ∫-compact objects.
This is Lurie, lemma 5.5.1.4.
This is HTT, prop. 5.5.3.10, prop. 5.5.3.11.
In particular the product of locally presentable (‚àû,1)-categories is again locally presentable.
This is HTT, prop. 5.5.2.2.
So consider first the case that C=PSh(D) is a presheaf category.
Then let F‚Ä≤:=Hom C(‚àí,f):PSh(D) op‚Üí‚àûGrpd the functor represented by f.
But this is the case precisely by the statement of the full (‚àû,1)-Yoneda lemma.
Let L:PSh(D)‚ÜíC be the left adjoint reflector.
By the above it is therefore represented by some object X‚ààPSh(D).
This is HTT, prop. 5.5.2.4.
(See also at Ho(CombModCat)).
This is Lurie, remark A.3.7.7.
The basic example is: Example ‚àûGrpd is locally presentable.
This is clearly compact, and hence generates ‚àûGrpd.
This is itself locally presentable

Introduction For x>0, let œÄ(x) denote the number of primes p‚â§x
(in these notes, p is always used to denote prime numbers).
Introduce a function Œ∏(x)=‚àë p‚â§xlog(p).
The asymptotic statement Œ∏(x)‚àºx implies the prime number theorem.
In one direction, we have an obvious inequality Œ∏(x)=‚àë p‚â§xlog(p)‚â§‚àë p‚â§xlog(x)=œÄ(x)log(x).
The first term on the right is bounded above by log(2)x.
The zeta function has no zeroes on the line Re(s)=1
is easily handled by the product formula (2).
Let ŒΩ be the order of the zero at 1¬±2it.
The asymptotic result Œ∏(x)‚àºx will be established by appeal to the following result: Theorem
Suppose that the integral ‚à´ 1 ‚àûŒ∏(x)‚àíxx 2dx converges.
So all that remains is to prove Theorem .
For T‚â•0, put g T(s)=‚à´ 0 Te ‚àístf(t)dt.
Clearly g T is an entire (i.e., everywhere holomorphic) function.
We are trying to show that limT‚Üí‚àûg T(0)=g(0).
Thus we instead use g T(0)‚àíg(0)=12œÄi‚à´ C(g T(z)‚àíg(z))e zT(1+z 2R 2)dzz
Suppose now that |f(t)| is globally bounded by B.
First let us bound 12œÄi‚à´ C ‚àíg T(z)e zT(1+z 2R 2)dzz.
Finally, we bound 12œÄi‚à´ C ‚àíg(z)e zT(1+z 2R 2)dzz.
The following classification is due to Rieffel 81.
This entry contains one chapter of the material at geometry of physics.
We discuss local (‚Äúextended‚Äù) topological prequantum field theory.
Here the pattern of the discussion of examples is the following:
The ambient topos Prequantum field theory deals with ‚Äúspaces of physical fields‚Äù.
We here need this to mean the following
Every cohesive (‚àû,1)-topos is in particular globally and locally ‚àû-connected, by definition.
This we discuss in Corner field theory.
We write Span n(H) for the resulting (‚àû,n)-category of spans.
All this we now describe more formally.
Therefore it makes sense to speak of bulk field theory in this case.
In (LurieTFT) this is denoted by ‚ÄúBord n fr‚Äù.
In itself this is a deep statement about the homotopy type of categories of cobordisms.
Every object in Span n(H) is a self-fully dualizable object.
The central definition in the present context now is the following.
For H= ‚àûGrpd this is the perspective in (FHLT, section 3).
We now discuss this notion of groupoids more formally.
This data is visualized as follows.
Here, for the time being, all groups are discrete groups.
(Here ‚Äú‚ô≠‚Äù denotes the ‚Äúflat modality‚Äù.)
Another canonical action is the action of G on itself by right multiplication.
This is known as the G-universal principal bundle.
See below in for more on this.
Below we generalize this to arbitrary homotopy types (def. ).
These correspondences of groupoids encode trajectories/histories of field configurations.
By prop. we have X√ó[Œ† 1(S 1),X]X‚âÉ[Œ† 1(S 1),X].
Along these lines one checks the required zig-zag identities.
This is described in def. below.
This is the original case in which derived functors were considered in homological algebra.
This entry discusses special aspects of this special situation.
One writes R kF:=H k‚àòRF.
The two aspects are deeply intertwined.

This is a special case of a notion of k-ary factorization system.
This is remarked on here.
We therefore call this class R 2L 1.
In both cases ‚äÜ is obvious.
Here L 2‚à©R 1 is the class of monic epics, sometimes called bimorphisms?.
The maps in R 2L 1 are sometimes called strict morphisms.

In particular the Œî-cohomology is not an associative algebra.
For free field theories this yields Wick's lemma and Feynman diagrams for computing observables.
Multivector fields may be understood in terms of Hochschild cohomology of C.
Let (X,{‚àí,‚àí}) be a smooth Poisson manifold.

As topological vector spaces are uniform spaces, it is appropriate to discuss completeness.
Where this gets interesting is in the question as to what should be there.
To determine this, one has to have some method of discovering holes.
In strict order of decreasing strength, we have the following notions of completeness.
Sequentially complete implies locally complete because every locally Cauchy sequence is a Cauchy sequence.
A direct and short proof was later given in (Rudin 68).
compact subspaces of Hausdorff spaces are closed
closed subspaces of compact Hausdorff spaces are equivalently compact subspaces
CW-complexes are paracompact Hausdorff spaces Hausdorff spaces are sober
Accordingly this statement came to be known as Stone‚Äôs theorem.
For ordinary cohomology H ‚Ä¢(‚àí,A) the abelian group A is the coefficient group.
In particular, every local category has initial objects.
All left primes form another spectrum, Spel(R).
Prime localizing subcategories form certain spectrum.
The cohomology of the stack is then indeed the equivariant cohomology of the original manifold.
Derived stacks on this site are studied in derived algebraic geometry.
There are various slight variations of this.
This cannot happen for ‚àû-stacks over 1-categorical site.
A notable example of this is the case where C= CRing and U=SpecR.
But there must be a better reference, somewhere.

The ideas here generalize in many directions.
Draw an analogy with vector spaces (maybe just finite-dimensional ones?).
We can make this precise by comparing the groupoids Vect ‚àº and Vect b. ‚Ä¶
But structurally, this definition is meaningless.
Accordingly, it makes sense to compare them for equality.

This pertains to the mathematical foundations of category theory.
But of course, this is more complicated!
The traditional definition goes as follows:
This definition involves equality of sets, which violates the principle of equality.
This stemmed from the fact that category theorists were using functors to define the dagger.

This is discussed at spectral sequence of a filtered stable homotopy type.
For motivation see the example Spectral sequence of a filtered complex below.
Throughout, let ùíú be an abelian category.
One says in this cases that the spectral sequence degenerates at r s.
One says in this case that the spectral sequence collapses on this page.
Therefore if all but one row or column vanish, then all these differentials vanish.
A bounded spectral sequence, def. , has a limit term, def. .
But in general this need not be the case.
(See there for details).
This is discussed at spectral sequence of a double complex.

Here we refer to these Cat-enriched weighted limits as strict 2-limits.
It just occurred to me that ‚Äòstrict initial object‚Äô conflicts with this.
But unlike ‚Äòweak limit‚Äô, that doesn‚Äôt generalise very far.
Heh, you‚Äôre right.
Likewise we have strict oplax limits where the transformation goes in the other direction.
In particular, any strict flexible limit is also a limit.
, then these two notions coincide (Gambino 2007).
Thus we have strict products, strict pullbacks, strict equalizers, and so on.
In particular, there is still a specified projection to each object in the diagram.
These are to be distinguished from:
However, with lax limits the situation is more serious.
This is described in the references below.
This observation leads to the following generalization

The following are equivalent: The principle of excluded middle.
The proof is as follows.
Thus, all finite sets are choice.

This argument, due originally to Diaconescu 75, can be internalized in any topos.

A pretopos is a category which is both exact and extensive.
This implies that it is a coherent category.
Pretoposes are suitable as frameworks for finitist predicative mathematics, respectively with coherent logic.
Frequently one is especially interested in pretoposes having additional properties, such as:
Every pretopos with choice is automatically boolean.
(A Œ†-pretopos is automatically a Heyting pretopos.)
These are suitable as frameworks for finitist constructive mathematics which is ‚Äòweakly predicative‚Äô.
(Here, we take any exponentiable morphism to define a polynomial endofunctor.
These are suitable as frameworks for weakly predicative constructive mathematics that is not finitist.
(Now every morphism defines a polynomial endofunctor, since every morphism is exponentiable.)
A topos is a pretopos that has power objects.
An infinitary pretopos is an infinitary coherent category which is both infinitary extensive and exact.
Extensivity and exactness make a Heyting pretopos a very set-like category.
In a pretopos, this topology is generated by finite jointly epimorphic families.
The codomain fibration of a pretopos is always a stack for its precanonical topology.
The term ‚Äúcoloured PROP‚Äù has been used.
Let C be a monoidal category.
Similarly, Œî a op is a PRO whose models are comonoids.
The cartesian monoidal analogue is known as a Lawvere theory.
See also differentiation and derivative.
The approximating linear maps at different points together form the derivative of the map.
One may then ask whether the derivative itself is differentiable, and so on.
Infinitely differentiable maps are sometimes called smooth.
The map df x is called the derivative or differential of f at x.
This is easy to see; just let E(h)=f(x+h)‚àíf(x)‚àídf x(h)‚Äñh‚Äñ.
Here h is just a real number.
In particular, the coordinates of df x are the partial derivatives of f.
We can then iterate, obtaining the following hierarchy of differentiability.
We begin with this since a differentiable map is necessarily continuous.
A twice differentiable map must be continuously differentiable.
(There is no difference between infinite differentiability and infinite continuous differentiability.)
One step higher, we may ask whether f is analytic or C œâ.
The same is true in constructive mathematics as long as one assumes dependent choice.
For this reason, uniform differentiability is particularly important in constructive mathematics.
It suffices to assume m=1; otherwise we just consider it componentwise.
Define a function g:‚Ñù‚Üí‚Ñù by g(Œæ)=f(x+Œæv+w)‚àíf(x+Œæv).
But bilinearity of the LHS then implies that it is identically zero.
and if it holds, then the bilinear map ‚àÇ 2f x must be symmetric.
Then we have E(v,Œ¥e i)=f(x+v+Œ¥e i)‚àíf(x+v)‚àíf(x+Œ¥e i)+f(x)‚àí‚àÇ 2f x(v,Œ¥w)|v|Œ¥
Thus, df is differentiable at x.
(Note that U√ó‚Ñù n is the tangent bundle of U‚äÜ‚Ñù n.)
We sketch the proof, omitting the explicit error terms.
However, its derivative is not continuous at 0.
Uniform differentiability is stronger than continuous differentiability but independent of twice differentiability.
Similarly, e ‚àí1/x 2sin(e 1/x 2) is pointwise smooth.
See e.g. this MSE answer.
For symmetric multicategories we have the following.
Let P be a symmetric operad over Set
This is (Heuts, theorem 1.6).
Fibrations over the terminal multicategory are equivalently representable multicategories (Hermida, corollary 4.3).
Every morphism factors as a split epimorphism followed by a monomorphism.
Any pair of split epimorphisms in R has an absolute pushout.

Such a transformation is called a cone over the diagram F.
A cocone in C is precisely a cone in the opposite category C op.

Conjunction is de Morgan dual to disjunction.
Conjunction also has an identity element, which is the true truth value.

The Poincar√© group ISO(d,1) is the isometry group of Minkowski spacetime of dimension d+1.

This is the generalization of the notion of symplectic manifold to higher symplectic geometry.
A symplectic groupoid is the Lie integration of such a Poisson Lie algebroid.
Therefore, strictly speaking, already ‚Äúordinary‚Äù symplectic geometry secretly involves Lie groupoids.
This insight is exploited in the refinement of geometric quantization of symplectic groupoids.
We say an object on SymplSmooth‚àûGrpd is a symplectic smooth ‚àû-groupoid.
We spell this out in some special cases.
We discuss the Lie integration of Poisson Lie algebroids to symplectic groupoids.
The notion of symplectic manifold formalizes in physics the concept of a classical mechanical system .

See below for Grothendieck‚Äôs own formulation of it.
It has not been proven in its original form.
One such proof is given in Cisinski 08.
Proof Any equivalence of categories preserves colimits.
Now, equivalences of categories also preserve final objects.
Thus we have that F(1 Set)=1 Set for all F.
The proposition follows immediately from these two observations.
This argument is rather canonical.

The most classical notion is the following.
There is at least one object c‚ààC such that E(c) is an inhabited set.
Hence, this notion of flatness may be called representably flat.
A proof of this is given below as prop. .
Let E be a cocomplete topos (for instance a Grothendieck topos).
In Mac Lane-Moerdijk, VII.8 they are called ‚Äúfiltering functors‚Äù.
In Moerdijk, II.2 they are called ‚Äúprincipal functors‚Äù.
Finally, we can give the most general definition, due to Karazeris
Definition Let E be any site.
For disambiguation, we may refer to this notion as being covering-flat.
This subsumes the other three definitions as follows:
So this is a filtered colimit.
Proof This is VII.9.1 in Mac Lane-Moerdijk.
In other words, Sh(C) is the classifying topos for such functors.
When regarded in this way, flat functors are also known as ind-objects.
This is due to (KarazerisVelebil).
One says that PSh(C) is the classifying topos for internally flat functors out of C.
Examples Morphisms of sites are flat functors which additionally preserve covering families.
Enriched flat functors are studied and characterized in

I think you‚Äôre right about Pratt‚Äôs work, see example 5 here.

It follows that every two strict localizations are not only equivalent but in fact isomorphic.

In this case Œ± is called a Hamiltonian (n-1)-form for v.
For instance (X,œâ) might be a symplectic ‚àû-groupoid.
In particular it is independent of the choice of prequantum line bundle.
This is precisely the definition of Hamiltonian vector fields.

This entry is about the notion of skeleton in category theory.
For the notion of (co)skeletal simplicial sets see at simplicial skeleton.
A weak skeleton of C is any skeletal category which is weakly equivalent to C.
Denote by in:sk(C)‚ÜíC the inclusion.
We exhibit a weak inverse of in as a functor ‚àí‚Ä≤:x‚Ü¶x‚Ä≤ constructed as follows.
The rule for morphisms ‚àí‚Ä≤:f‚Ü¶f‚Ä≤:=i y‚àòf‚àòi x ‚àí1 is clearly functorial.
Let us show that ‚àí‚Ä≤ is a weak inverse of in.
This completes the proof that ‚àí‚Ä≤ is indeed a weak inverse of in.
Using the above definition, we can canonically define the skeleton of an indexed category.
Let œà:‚Ñ¨ op‚Üí‚Ñ≠ùîûùî± be an indexed category.
Let p:‚Ñ∞‚Üí‚Ñ¨ be a fibration.
For details, see the subobject fibration section of codomain fibration.
In this section we collect some properties of skeleta in set-level foundations.
Thus, the notion of skeletal category violates the principle of equivalence.
Without any choice, we have the following theorems.
Notice that the axiom of choice fails in general when one considers internal categories.
Hence not every internal category has a skeleton.
In Categories, Allegories it is shown that the following are equivalent.
The axiom of choice holds.
Any two ana-equivalent categories are strongly equivalent.
Any two weakly equivalent categories are strongly equivalent.
Every small category has a weak skeleton.
Every small category has a coskeleton.
Any two weak skeletons of a given small category are isomorphic.
Any two coskeletons of a given small category are isomorphic.
More explicitly, consider the notion of cartesian product in a category.
In intensional type theory such as homotopy type theory, additional care is needed.

An inner product space is simply a vector space equipped with an inner product.

An inner product is definite iff it's both semidefinite and nondegenerate.
In a similar way, every inner product space has a nondegenerate quotient.
Now suppose that k is equipped with a partial order.
Hence, a definite inner product is either positive or negative definite.

If X is connected and X‚ÜíY is epic, then Y is connected.
We begin with some easy preliminary remarks.
It follows that Mod R(R n,‚àí) preserves coproducts.
(As adapted from Gaillard‚Äôs answer.)
This means that infinitely many components f i:M‚ÜíB i are nonzero.
Then if Mod R(N,‚àí) is coproduct-preserving, so is Mod R(M,‚àí).
(As adapted from Muro‚Äôs answer.)
Consider a family B i of modules, and a map f:M‚Üí‚äï iB i.
If Mod R(M,‚àí) preserves coproducts, then M is finitely generated.
(Combining Gaillard‚Äôs and Muro‚Äôs answers.)
Suppose M is not finitely generated.
Let M‚Ä≤ be the union of the M i.
By Theorem 1, the representable Mod R(M‚Ä≤,‚àí) does not preserve coproducts.
By Theorem 2, we infer that Mod R(M,‚àí) does not preserve coproducts.
Thus, Noetherian rings are steady.
Assume that M is not finitely generated.
Clearly the poset P is nonempty and has no maximal element.
There is thus a finitely generated submodule F of M which generates M modulo U.

It is an embedding if f * is fully faithful.
This is called the constant object of E on the set S.

Consider first those objects of the form U‚ààSmoothCartSp‚Ü™FormalSmoothCartSp‚Ü™FormalSmooth0Type.
Consider then objects of the form U√óùîª for ùîª the infinitesimal interval.
By prop. this is already equivalent to f being a local diffeomorphism.
Frame bundles the following is some semi-traditional basic discussion.
Need to see what to do with this here.
We write [(Œª ij)]‚ààH smooth 1(X,GL n).
This defines a morphism of smooth groupoids œÑ X:X‚ÜíBGL(n).
We now lift the above discussion of smooth manifolds inside smooth sets.
This proceeds essentially verbatim to the previous definitions
The traditional definition of smooth √©tale groupoids is the following:
We now rephrase this more intrinsically.
this is a pullback in degree-0 precisely already if ùí¢ ‚Ä¢ is √©tale.
That principal bundle is the frame bundle of X.
The Atiyah groupoid of T infX is the jet groupoid of X. Lemma
For order k-jets this is sometimes written GL k(V)
This class of examples of framings is important:
By lemma it follows that:
This exhibits T infX‚ÜíX as a ùîª V-fiber ‚àû-bundle.
This is discussed further at geometry of physics ‚Äì G-structure and Cartan geometry.

It has been introduced in the work of Weber at the end of 19th century.
It is one of the central notions in class field theory.
A later version is due Emil Artin.
This extension is necessarily F[‚àí1].
See also fundamental theorem of algebra.
As a field, F is elementarily equivalent to the field of real numbers.
This is called a real closure of the ordered field F.
Therefore we may speak of the real closure of F, which we denote as F¬Ø.
But this subfield is also real closed.
The real numbers form a real closed field.
Surreal numbers form a (large) real closed field.
Any o-minimal ordered ring structure R is a real closed field.
The field of fractions of B is clearly R.
Each of the elements of ‚Ñö¬Ø is archimedean.
Let B * be the group of units of B.
The quotient R */B * is the value group of R.
Proposition Let (ùíû,‚äó,I) be a monoidal model category.
A derived functor exists if its restriction to this subcategory preserves weak equivalences.
Hence ‚äó L exists and its associativity follows simply by restriction.
It remains to see its unitality.
We fix notation as follows: ‚àÖ‚ü∂‚ààCofi XQX‚ü∂‚ààW‚à©Fibp xX,X‚ü∂‚ààW‚à©Cofj XRX‚ü∂‚ààFibq x*.
The most common definition requires the presenting groupoid to be √©tale and proper.
Note that these properties can be defined not only in smooth- or topological context.
Note that this definition is redundant since properness implies stability.
There is further terminology applicable to orbifold groupoids:
Points p‚àà|C| H having more than one inverse image are called branch points.
C is called compact if |C| H is.
Note that here the properness axiom is relaxed.
Let ùí™ ‚äó be an (‚àû,1)-operad.
This is (Lurie, def. 2.1.2.13).
Therefore by the (‚àû,1)-Grothendieck construction it is classified by an (‚àû,1)-functor œá:ùí™‚Üí(‚àû,1)Cat.
The types of the programming language are interpreted as objects of the categories.
The left tensor (f‚ãâX):Y‚äóX‚ÜíZ‚äóX is given by the composite Y√óX‚ÜífT(Z)√óX‚ÜístrT(Z√óX) in ùïç.
Then a commutative Freyd category FinSet bij‚Üí‚ÑÇ is the same thing as a PROP.
This relates to the situation with monads as follows.
And this is a Freyd category if and only if the monad is strong.
Freyd categories are Enriched Lawvere Theories.
‚ÄúArrows are strong monads‚Äù.
Notice that these texts overlap.

Indeed Hegel‚Äôs system clearly defies any attempt to formalize it in predicate logic.
However, there is more to formal logic than plain predicate logic.
Of course this will require that philosophers learn mathematics and that mathematicians learn philosophy.
We survey the matching of the formalization to Hegel‚Äôs text in.
These are the models of homotopy type theory.
This way homotopy type theory overlaps much with (higher) categorical logic.
See at relation between type theory and category theory for more background on this.
In the categorical semantics this is the internal hom.
Leaving that implicit is arguably the greatest source of ambiguity in Aristotle‚Äôs logic.
The inverse equivalence B is called delooping.
See at looping and delooping for more.
Some B 1 is B 2.
See at cohomology for more on this general concept of cohomology.
Some B 1 is B 2.s:B 1√óCB 2product type
Individual E is B.e:E‚ÜíBunit type/global element Deduction
The figure E‚àíB‚àíA Functions may be composed.
Analogously, the categorical semantics for Some B 1 is B 2.
All B 2 is A.
Hence, No B 1 is A.
Some externalizations of homotopy type theory exhibit these, others do not.
This being a projection means that ‚óØX‚âÉ‚óØ‚óØX.
In categorical semantics this means essentially that ‚ñ° is an idempotent comonad.
The category H ‚óØ is equivalently the Eilenberg-Moore category of ‚óØ.
It is fairly familiar from the practice of category theory that adjunctions express oppositions.
This has been considered in (Lawvere 00) Example
Negation ist das, was wir Grenze hei√üen.
Etwas ist nur in seiner Grenze und durch seine Grenze das, was es ist.
In general there is no reason for this to be the case.
Consider the case of an opposition of the form ‚óØ‚ä£‚ñ°.
But this forces it to be the terminal obect itself.
depends crucially on the restriction to 0-types.
See at differential hexagon for the proof.
This implies in particular that ‚óØJ‚âÉ*. Progression
There is the unit type *.
Every type has a unique map X‚Üí* to that.
Dually there is the empty type ‚àÖ.
As a concept, this is the concept with no instance.
This trivially resolves the initial opposition.
This equivalently means to demand that the double negation subtopos is essential .
Hence ‚ô≠ is the moment of pure discreteness.
We may hence also say that ‚ô≠X is the ‚Äúpoint content‚Äù of X.
We ask this to have definite negation, def. .
Together these are the axioms of cohesion as considered in (Lawvere 07).
(There it is additionally asked that  É preserves binary Cartesian products.)
Therefore we further add labels as follows.
By remark the shape modality  É determines a concept of similarity of types.
Hence this unity of opposites is geometric quality.
Recall the Brown representability theorem from stable homotopy theory:
For more amplification of this point see at Differential cohomology is Cohesive homotopy theory.
Here the moments appearing in the hexagon have the following interpretation.
Hence in summary we have found determinations as follows.
Continuing the process, we posit a further opposition of moments lifting the previous ones.
More in detail, we may ask just how small these small paths are.
Hence with these moments posited, types now have qualities of synthetic differential geometry.
The minimal choice is ‚Ñ§/2‚Ñ§-grading.
We indicate this notationally by e‚âî‚áù¬Ø
In summary we now have arrived at the following process of determinations.
We conclude the process at this point.
The negative of id is *. The opposite of * is ‚àÖ.
The negative of ‚àÖ is maybe.
These are precisely the pointed types.
For details see at Quantization via Linear homotopy types.
We now indicate some of these new constructions.
Let G be a an ‚àû-group type.
We say that BG is the delooping of G.
Let ùîæ be an abelian ‚àû-group type.
With this one has GÀú‚âÉB p+1ùîæ conn.
This is the kind of field content of higher gauged WZW models.
We call this the WZW term whose curvature is Œº(Œ∏ G).
See also at geometry of physics ‚Äì manifolds and orbifolds.
Since the bosonic modality provides Aufhebung for ‚Ñú‚ä£‚Ñë we have ‚áù‚Ñë‚âÉ‚Ñë.
Finally ‚áù preserves pullbacks (being in particular a right adjoint).

We call this the left invariant G-structure.
Consider any group homomorphism G‚ÜíGL(V).
Indeed, this is a phenomenon known as the torsion constraints in supergravity.

The hom-functor preserves limits in both arguments separately.
So the hom-functor is the image of the identity functor under this inclusion.
(The 2-category Topos of all toposes is not locally essentially small.)
Every sheaf topos over a posite is localic.
(See there for details.)
It was a watershed event for the penetration of localic methods in topos theory.
Proposition Localic toposes correspond exactly to classifying toposes of propositional theories.
This appears in Johnstone (2002, D3.1.14, p.897f.).
The relation between L and ‚Ñô L is that Sh(L)‚âÉSet[‚Ñô L].
This is certainly propositional, its deductive closure consists of all tautologies using ‚ä•,‚ä§,‚àß,‚ãÅ.
Notice that a locale is itself a (Grothendieck) (0,1)-topos.
In the wider context this would be called a 1-localic (1,1)-topos.

The Whitehead tower construction produces n-connected objects.
One adopts the following convenient terminology.
A (‚àí1)-connected object is also called an inhabited object.
A 0-connected object is simply called a connected object.

It uses the internal logic of a topos to develop a part of mathematics.
This is closely related to topology via logic and abstract Stone duality.
Thus types may be regarded not just as sets but as topological objects.

First to set up some notation:
Schur functors may be viewed as a categorification of Schur functions.
The concept first appears in work by Carl Jacobi on determinants.

This constitutes a generalized notion of locally ringed toposes called ùí¢-structured (‚àû,1)-toposes.
If only all finite products exist we speak of a pre-geometry.
Every pregeometry ùíØ extends uniquely ùíØ‚Ü™ùí¢ to an enveloping geometry ùí¢.
Various concepts for geometries have immediate analogues for pregeometries.

See derived √©tale geometry for the precise statement.
See Deligne-Mumford stack for details.
There should be a geometry ùí¢ such that ùí¢-generalized schemes are precisely derived smooth manifolds.
The general theory is developed in Jacob Lurie, Structured Spaces

This entry is about a general class of sites.
For the specific site CartSp of cartesian spaces, see there.
Cartesian sites play a central role in the construction of classifying topos.

Let X be a simplicial set.
Let f:X‚ÜíY be a homomorphism of simplicial sets.
Also see coskeleton for more details.
We first discuss the absolute tower and then the relative version.
Let X be a Kan complex.
Write X(n):=X/ ‚àº n for the quotient simplicial set.
There are evident morphisms X(n)‚ÜíX(n‚àí1).
This appears for instance as (Goerss-Jardine, theorem Vi 2.5).
We discuss a model for the relative Postnikov tower, def. .
Proposition This construction gives indeed a relative Postnikov tower for f.
This is due to John Duskin.
See for instance (Beke, pages 302-305).
This is discussed in (BFGM).
Remark Let f ‚Ä¢:V ‚Ä¢‚ü∂W ‚Ä¢ be a chain map between chain complexes
This follows by elementary and straightforward direct inspection.
These are the categorical homotopy groups in L lwhesPSh(C) loc.
Therefore the claim now follows from the stalkwise long exact sequence of homotopy groups.
It is known that Postnikov systems classify all weak, pointed connected homotopy types.
This gives an algebraic model of such an n-type.
The various higher homotopy van Kampen theorems are useful in the latter case.
The reference below shows the problems in the 3-stage systems.
Then there is a weak homotopy equivalence K(n)‚Üí‚âÉK(œÄ n(X,v),n).
We may think of Top as being the archetypical (‚àû,1)-category.
One can generalize also to the Maurer-Cartan form on a principal bundle.
The Maurer-Cartan form is a Lie-algebra valued form with vanishing curvature.
This is known as the Maurer-Cartan equation.
This is what analytically becomes the statement of vanishing curvature.
Morphisms X‚Üí‚ô≠ dRBG correspond to flat ùî§-valued differential forms on G.
For G an ordinary Lie group, this reduces to the above definition.
This statement and its proof is spelled out here.
The synthetic Maurer-Cartan form itself appears in example 3.7.2.
The synthetic vanishing of its curvature is corollary 6.7.2.
The troubles stem from the reservoir attached to the anti-de Sitter universe.
This is not an innocuous assumption.
Idea A supercommutative ring is an ‚Ñ§-supercommutative algebra.
A (topological) space whose only connected subspaces are singletons is called totally disconnected.
Example Discrete spaces are totally disconnected.
Hence no inhabited open subspace of the rational numbers is connected.
A product in Top of totally disconnected spaces is totally disconnected.
A subspace of a totally disconnected space is totally disconnected.
Hence limits in Top of diagrams of totally disconnected spaces are totally disconnected.
Similarly, Cantor space 2 ‚Ñï is totally disconnected.
Another notable special case of the preceding class of examples is the following.
See also Stone space.
The general class of examples in Example may be seen in the following light.
We check that connected components C of X/‚àº are singletons.

A projective line is a projective space of dimension 1.
There are, however, plenty of projective lines not arising from projective planes.
For instance, we might set Œõ(p,q)=1 for all p,q.
Conversely, every Desarguesian projective line arises from a division ring in this way.

Furthermore assume that L is at least quadratic in the vertical coordinates around œÜ.
Therefore we now consider this case in detail.
In this case one says that the gauge parameter bundle ùí¢‚ÜígbŒ£ is a generating set.
Take K to be as in equation (3): dJ R=A+dK.
We will need some further technical results on Noether identities:
Here are examples of infinitesimal gauge symmetries in Lagrangian field theory:
This is the archetypical infinitesimal gauge symmetry that gives gauge theory its name.
We further discuss these higher gauge transformations below.
We write dgcSAlg for the category of differential graded-commutative superalgebra.
In fact both these concepts unify into the concept of an action Lie algebroid:
(We discuss homomorphism between Lie ‚àû-algebroid below in def. .)
See at Higher Structures for exposition.
We write Bùî§ or */ùî§ for ùî§ regarded as a Lie algebroid this way.
Here is another basic examples of Lie algebroids that will plays a role:
This is called the tangent Lie algebroid of Œ£.
More generally, let E‚ÜífbŒ£ be a fiber bundle over Œ£.

Proposition Not all Dold fibrations are Serre fibrations.
Here is a very simple counter-example due to Dold.
Then this map is a Dold fibration but not a Serre fibration.
I just made it up, suggestions appreciated).
For these maps there exists a long exact sequence in homotopy once basepoints are chosen.
Observation Every shrinkable map is a Dold fibration.
Let {U i‚ÜíX} be a numerable open cover.
Then the canonical map |C({U i})|‚ÜíX is shrinkable, hence a Dold fibration.
This observation is due to Segal.
These are called gauged supergravity theories.
These induce gauged supergravities (e.g. Samtleben 08, figure 1).

Explicitly, the tangent ‚àû-category is given as follows.
This is the first part of the proof of DT. prop. 1.1.9.
In particular, it admits all (‚àû,1)-limits and (‚àû,1)-colimits.

Consider then a sufficiently deep transfinite composition œÅ tf.

First consider the base (‚àû,1)-topos H= ‚àûGrpd.
Applying remark in remark yields that T X(‚àûGrpd)‚âÉStab(Func(X,‚àûGrpd)).

This page contains a detailed introduction to basic topology.
This is called algebraic topology.
But the concept of topological spaces is a good bit more general.
Hence we discuss topology in its traditional form with classical logic.
For further reading along these lines see Johnstone 83. (set theory)
Apart from classical logic, we assume the usual informal concept of sets.
Let f:X‚ü∂Y be a function between sets.
Let {S i‚äÇX} i‚ààI be a set of subsets of X.
The injection in the second item is in general proper.
Let f:X‚ü∂Y be a function between sets.
Let {T i‚äÇY} i‚ààI be a set of subsets of Y.
Let (X,d), be a metric space.
A key source of metric spaces are normed vector spaces:
The following is now the fairly obvious definition of continuity for functions between metric spaces.
In particular the original distance function d(x,‚àí)=d({x},‚àí) is continuous in both its arguments.
Let x‚ààX and let œµ be a positive real number.
Hence polynomials are continuous functions.
(the empty subset is open)
Regard the real numbers ‚Ñù as the 1-dimensional Euclidean space (example ).
For the record, we spell it out:
First assume that f is continuous in the epsilontic sense.
Hence this is an open ball of the required kind.
We now briefly recall these concepts from analysis.
Let (X,d) be a metric space (def. ).
Here the point x ‚àû is called the limit of the sequence.
Often one writes limi‚Üí‚àûx i for this point.
Finally recall the concept of compactness of metric spaces via epsilontic analysis:
we should pay attention to open subsets in metric spaces.
(The second of these may seem less obvious than the first.
We discuss the general logic behind these kinds of phenomena below.)
A set X equipped with such a topology is called a topological space.
But beware that there are other kinds of spaces in mathematics.
The combinatorial nature of these definitions makes topology be closely related to formal logic.
This becomes more manifest still for the ‚Äúsober topological space‚Äù discussed below.
For more on this perspective see the remark on locales below, remark .
An introductory textbook amplifying this perspective is (Vickers 89).
This is called the metric topology.
(This is also called the initial topology of the inclusion map.
We come back to this below in def. .)
(This is also called the final topology of the projection œÄ.
We come back to this below in def. . )
The following examples illustrate how all these ingredients and construction principles may be combined.
These subsets are called the Zariski closed subsets.
These are called the Zariski open subsets of k n.
Write PrimeIdl(R) for its set of prime ideals.
These are called the Zariski closed subsets of PrimeIdl(R).
Their complements are called the Zariski open subsets.
Let (X,œÑ) be a topological space (def. ).
(closure of a finite union is the union of the closures)
This implis that the given point is contained in the set on the right.
First assume that V‚äÇX is closed and that x i‚ü∂i‚Üí‚àûx ‚àû for some x ‚àû‚ààX.
We need to show that then x ‚àû‚ààV.
Suppose on the contrary that such œµ did not exist.
Hence then we could choose points x k‚ààB x ‚àò(1/k)‚à©V in these intersections.
Often one considers closed subsets inside a closed subspace.
The following is immediate, but useful.
Under these identifications, the two conditions are manifestly the same.
(frame homomorphisms preserve inclusions)
Below in def. we highlight these as the continuous functions between topological spaces.
Proposition (irreducible closed subsets are equivalently frame homomorphisms to opens of the point)
See also (Johnstone 82, II 1.3).
Finally, it is clear that these two operations are inverse to each other.
We may equivalently state this in terms of closed subsets:
Proof This follows since taking pre-images commutes with taking complements.
The two categories Top and Set are different, but related.
One also speaks of a forgetful functor.
A category equipped with a faithful functor to Set is called a concrete category.
Hence Top is canonically a concrete category.
(product topological space construction is functorial)
Moreover, this construction respects identity functions and composition of functions in both arguments.
We come back to this below in example .
Below in prop. we find a large supply of closed maps.
Here f ‚àí1(f(S)) is also called the f-saturation of S.
Therefore it now only remains to see that U‚äÉV‚äÉC.
The inclusion V‚äÉC is equivalent to f ‚àí1(f(X‚àñU))‚à©C=‚àÖ.
Since C is saturated by assumption, this is equivalent to f ‚àí1(f(X‚àñU))‚à©f ‚àí1(f(C))=‚àÖ.
, we obtain the concept of ‚Äúsameness‚Äù in topology.
Beware the following notation:
The underlying function of sets of f is a bijection.
The inverse function of sets however fails to be continuous at (1,0)‚ààS 1‚äÇ‚Ñù 2.
Hence this f is not a homeomorphism.
But immediate from the definitions is the foll
There are several discussions and variation of surface diagrams available.

These integral kernels are the advanced/retarded ‚Äúpropagators‚Äù.
The last step is simply the application of Euler's formula sin(Œ±)=12i(e iŒ±‚àíe ‚àíiŒ±).
This integration domain may then further be completed to two contour integrations.
Corollary (causal propagator is skew-symmetric)
The last line is Œî H(x,y), by definition .
Proposition (skew-symmetric part of Wightman propagator is the causal propagator)
On the left this identifies the causal propagator by (13), prop. .

As a consequence, a representable Y has a canonical section to any weak representation X.
Let X be any topological space.
(one-point extension is well-defined)
We need to show that this has a finite subcover.
Let X be a locally compact topological space.
It is clear that if X is not Hausdorff then X * is not.
For the converse, assume that X is Hausdorff.
Let X be a topological space.
This is immediate from the definition of X *.
To see this, note that such a map is necessarily unique.
It suffices to show existence.
Extend f to a map f *:X *‚ÜíY
It follows that f * is continuous.
This property characterizes X * in an essentially unique manner.
X is dense in X * precisely if X is not already compact.
Note that X * is technically a compactification of X only in this case.
This is briefly mentioned in Bredon 93, p. 199.

In order to prove this, we further develop the theory of reflective subuniverses.

There are a number of equivalent definitions of the concept of Frobenius algebra.
There are Further equivalent definitions As associative algebra with coalgebra structure
In terms of string diagrams, this definition says:
The third line shows the Frobenius laws.
In such a case, œµ is called a Frobenius form.
There are about a dozen equivalent definitions of a Frobenius algebra.
Ross Street (2004) lists most of them.
We can define ‚Äòcommutative‚Äô Frobenius algebras in any symmetric monoidal category.
If Œº‚àòŒ¥=1, a Frobenius algebra is said to be special.
So, any strongly separable algebra becomes a special Frobenius algebra in a unique way.
For more details, see separable algebra and Aguiar (2000).
The other triangle identity uses the other Frobenius law and unit and counit axioms.
Frobenius algebras are closely connected with ambidextrous adjunctions.
Certain kinds of Frobenius algebras have nice PROPs or PROs.
This means that any commutative Frobenius algebra gives a 2d TQFT.
In 2Cob, the circle is a Frobenius algebra.
The monoid laws look like this:
The comonoid laws look like this:
This is worth comparing to the PROP for commutative bialgebras, which is Span(FinSet).
This is analogous to how a bimonoid can be defined in any duoidal category.
Personal communications from other people who should know are in agreement.
Frobenius algebras were introduced by Brauer and Nesbitt and were named after Ferdinand Frobenius.

In quantum field theory reflection positivity is the incarnation of unitarity under Wick rotation.
, exactly one of the two spaces is the empty space.
According to def. the empty topological space is not regarded as connected.
Some authors do want the empty space to count as a connected space.
The conditions in def. are indeed equivalent.
We need to show that exactly one of the two subsets is empty.
This way the third condition is equivalent to the second.
In constructive mathematics the conditions in Def. no longer need to be equivalent.
This definition generalises to the notion of connected objects in an extensive category.
See also the discussion at empty space and at too simple to be simple.
It is called the connected component of x.
It is closed, by Result .
This is called the quasi-component of x, denoted here as QConn(x).
We need to show that precisely one of them is the empty set.
Since preimages preserve unions it also follows that p ‚àí1(U 1)‚à™p ‚àí1(U 2)=X.
Wide pushouts of connected spaces are connected.
More memorably: connected colimits of connected spaces are connected.
Let {X i} i‚ààI be a set of connected spaces.
This relies on some special features of Top.
A general abstract proof is given at connected object in this theorem and this remark.
We need to show that precisely one of the two is empty.
By induction this finally yields an x‚Ä≤ 1 as claimed.
Moreover they are still disjoint and cover X i.
Hence by the connectedness of X i, precisely one of them is empty.
Regard the real line with its Euclidean metric topology.
Suppose on the contrary that we have x<r<y but r‚àâS.
This yields a proof by contradiction.
The basic results above give a plethora of ways to construct connected spaces.
More exotic examples are sometimes useful, especially for constructing counterexamples.
The following, due to Bing, is a countable connected Hausdorff space.
Clearly any two such closures intersect, and therefore the space is connected.
This example is due to Golomb.
(locally constant function on connected topological spaces are constant functions)
By connectedness this cover must consist of a single non-empty element.
But by construction this means that f is constant.
An important variation on the theme of connectedness is path-connectedness.
One says that the path connects the point Œ≥(0)‚ààX with the point Œ≥(1)‚ààX.
The set of path connected components of X is denoted œÄ 0(X).
The resulting quotient space will be discrete if X is locally path-connected.)
We say X is path-connected if it has exactly one path component.
This would be in contradiction to the fact that intervals are connected.
Hence we have a proof by contradiction.
The path components and connected components do coincide if X is locally path-connected.
(As of course does example , trivially.)
Equivalently, that there are no non-constant paths.
This by far does not mean that the space is discrete!
For a proof of this theorem, see Willard, theorem 31.2.
Obviously X is compact (Hausdorff) and connected.
We claim ‚àÄ f(ùíû)‚âî{‚àÄ f(C)=¬¨f(¬¨C):C‚ààùíû} is an (evidently countable) base for X.
Put C=B 1‚à™‚Ä¶‚à™B n.
The first inclusion is equivalent to p‚àà‚àÄ f(C) by the adjunction f ‚àí1‚ä£‚àÄ f.
Thus we have shown ‚àÄ f(ùíû) is a base.
Let X be a nonempty Hausdorff space.
Then there exists a continuous surjection Œ±:[0,1]‚ÜíX if X is a Peano space.
In particular, a nonempty Peano space is path-connected.
The functor œÄ 0:Top‚ÜíSet preserves arbitrary products.
Then ‚ü®Œ± i‚ü©:I‚Üí‚àè iX i connects (x i) to (y i).
(Note this uses the axiom of choice.)
Then (x i) maps to (c i).
Again this uses the axiom of choice.
The functor œÄ 0:Top‚ÜíSet preserves arbitrary coproducts.
The functor hom(I,‚àí):Top‚ÜíSet preserves coproducts since I is connected, and similarly for hom(1,‚àí).
Pseudo-arcs Point-set topology is filled with counterexamples.
By example the interval [a,b] is connected.
By example also its image f([a,b])‚äÇ‚Ñù is connected.
By example that image is hence itself an interval.
Then also the topological closure Cl(S)‚äÇX is connected
Suppose that Cl(S)=A‚äîB with A,B‚äÇX disjoint open subsets.
We need to show that one of the two is empty.
Hence by the connectedness of S, one of A‚à©S or B‚à©S is empty.
Assume B‚à©S is empty, otherwise rename.
Hence A‚à©S=S, or equivalently: S‚äÇA.
This means that B=‚àÖ, and hence that Cl(S) is connected.
Then its connected components (def. ) are closed subsets.
The connected subsets of a space form a connectology.

Sometimes, higher dimensional knots are also considered.
Typically, knots are considered up to ambient isotopy (or smooth isotopy).

Let U:Coalg(M)‚ÜíM be the forgetful functor.
The cofree coalgebra refers to a functor right adjoint to U, if it exists.
As a first step, recall the following result.
This seems to be due to (Sweedler 69).
For a proof of this result, see for example (Michaelis 03).
For more see at coalgebra ‚Äì As filtered colimits.
Now let V be an infinite-dimensional vector space.
Indeed, suppose given a coalgebra C and a linear function f:C‚ÜíV.
Any such lift is obtained in just this way.
See also the nForum discussion here.
It remains to identify the coalgebra structure on k[x] (x).
The calculations work out cleanest if we assume if k is algebraically closed.
With this in mind, put e n(r)=(rx) n(1‚àírx) n+1 for n‚â•0.
We summarize the calculations above as follows.
Let L(0)=k[x] as a subspace of k[x] (x).

It is generally understood that models are approximations to reality.
The proverbial saying goes: Every model is wrong.
But some models are useful.

We give the proof below.
We need to show local finiteness.
It just remains to normalize these functions so that they indeed sum to unity.
Hence it makes sense to define f i‚âîh i/h.
The other direction is the statement of prop. .
Hausdorff spaces are sober compact subspaces of Hausdorff spaces are closed
In the other direction, not every subsequential space is induced by a topological one.
Despite these apparent drawbacks, subsequential spaces have a number of advantages; see below.
Accordingly, one may call a subsequential space a sequential pseudotopological space.
Also of note is that SeqTop is coreflective in Top.
In particular, it is complete and cocomplete, and has a small generating set.

This special case is the default meaning of equivariant bundle in much of the literature!
All of the discussion generalizes, say to smooth manifolds or general toposes.
We follow the terminology of SS 2021, Def. 2.1.2: Definition
(See Prop. below for the choice of notation used here.)
There are then two cases: Either the typical fiber is inhabited.

The first statement is evident.
It is clear by construction that the map is continuous.

A hypercomplex number is an element of one of these algebras.
There is only one hypercomplex number system of dimension 0, of course.
Observing that œï(e) 2=œï(e 2)=œï(1)=1, it follows that œï(e)‚àà{1,‚àí1,e,‚àíe}.
But if œï(e)‚àà{+1,‚àí1} then œï is not injective.
Famous hypercomplex number systems of dimension 4 include the quaternions and the bicomplex number?s.
In dimension 8, try the octonions and the biquaternion?s.
In dimension 16, try the sedenions and the bioctonion?s.
Of course, these are not the only possibilities by any means.
Another way to generate associative hypercomplex number systems is through Clifford algebras.
There is a thorough list of examples on the English Wikipedia.

Next we need to define morphisms of such charted 2-vector bundles.
These involve the evident refinements of covers and fiberwise transformations.
Now define ùí¶(V)=Œ©B(‚àê n‚â•0BGl n(V)).
It is hard to directly construct charted 2-vector bundles.
We have more examples of gerbes.
So we want to get one from the other.
Let (R,‚äï,‚äó,0,1,c ‚äï) be a bimonoidal category, i.e. a categorified rig.
Here c ‚äï is the evident natural isomorphism between direct sums of finite sets.
This gives a weak monoid structure.
Let Gl n(R) be the category of weakly invertible such matrices.
This is the full subcategory of Mat n(R).
This can also be written ‚ãØ‚âÉ‚Ñ§√ó|BGl n(R)| +.
Here B qGl n(R) is a simplicial category ‚Ä¶
The point is that the other monoidal structure ‚äó indeed makes this a ring spectrum.
For V ‚Ñù analogously we get the real K-theory spectrum.
The equivalence ùí¶(R)‚âÉK(HR) of topological spaces is even an equivalence of infinity loop space?s;

Of course, the details depend on the chosen type theory.
It is the special case of the notion of n-monomorphisms for n=1.
The dual concept is that of an epimorphism in an (‚àû,1)-category.

Commutative monoids with homomorphisms between them form a category of commutative monoids.
More generally, the concept makes sense internal to any symmetric monoidal category.

On the other hand, the concept of polarized algebraic variety is closely related.
Moreover, in general there is not even a global notion of canonical momenta.
The traditional notion of polarization applies to a symplectic manifold.

Thus, the Karoubi envelope is a completion operation into such categories.
There is an Abstract definition that characterizes idempotent completions.
In particular the idempotent completion always exists and is unique up to equivalence of categories.
Explicit constructions include: Construction in components Construction via the Yoneda embedding
See e.g. (Lurie, def. 5.1.4.1).
Let C be a category.
We give an elementary construction of the Karoubi envelope C¬Ø which formally splits idempotents in C.
This functor is full and faithful: it fully embeds C in C¬Ø.
Thus the pair (p,j) formally splits the idempotent e:c‚Üíc.
The details are spelled out here.
More details on this are at Semicategory - Relation to categories.
Now we make some easy observations: Fix(p)‚äÜg ‚àí1(0).
The derivative dg(0):T 0(U)‚ÜíT 0(kerdp(0))‚âÖkerdp(0) is œÄ again since Id‚àídp(0) is idempotent.

Identifying ‚Äúsymplectic groupoids‚Äù as 2-plectic groupoids

This is the traditional topic of geometric quantization of symplectic groupoids.
Here we just collect some of the main ingredients needed below.
The transgression is witnessed by a Chern-Simons element cs œÄ.
Infinitesimally this yields the Poisson sigma-model.

There are various slight variants of the definition of Kan extension .
These define the extension of an entire functor, by an adjointness relation.
Furthermore, a pointwise Kan extension can be ‚Äúabsolute‚Äù.
It is certainly true that most Kan extensions which arise in practice are pointwise.
This distinction is even more important in enriched category theory.
The local definition of right Kan extensions along p is dual.
(Reviews include (Riehl, I 1.3)).
First, here is a characterization that doesn‚Äôt rely on any computational framework:
expressed in terms of an end as (Ran pF)(c‚Ä≤)‚âÉ‚à´ c‚ààCC‚Ä≤(c‚Ä≤,p(c))‚ãîF(c).
But the above equivalence relation is precisely that under which this composite would be invariant.
This appears for instance as (Borceux, I, thm 3.7.2).
The components of Œ∑ F over c‚ààC are morphisms Œ∑ F(c):F(c)‚Üí(Lan pF)(p(c)).
Non-pointwise Kan extensions seem to be very rare in practice.
See there for the precise statement.
This is discussed in (Lack 09, section 2.2).
See (Roald, Example 2.24) for details.
Then the left Kan extension lan fg exists.
There is no chance that the lemma is true when A is a large category.
Then the left Kan extension lan fg exists.
Let A‚ÜífB be a functor.
Indeed, having a dense generator is a good compromise between generality and tameness.
Then the left Kan extension lan fg exists.
I am not aware of a reference for this result.
Notably ùí± may be Set.
The second statement appears for instance as (Kelly, prop. 4.23).
Here the last step is called sometimes the co-Yoneda lemma.
Left Kan extensions preserving certain limits
Therefore (by the discussion here) it is a cofinal functor.
A similar result holds for (‚àû,1)-categories.
The central point about examples of Kan extensions is: Kan extensions are ubiquitous .
But any list is necessarily wildly incomplete.
see also examples of Kan extensions
Let f:X‚ÜíY be a continuous map and F a presheaf over X.
For Grothendieck sites such f(V) would not make even sense.
But inclusion f(V)‚äÇW implies V‚äÇf ‚àí1(f(V))‚äÇf ‚àí1(W).
The latter identity V‚äÇf ‚àí1(W) involves only open sets.
Thus we take a colimit over the comma category (V‚Üìf ‚àí1) of G.
This usage of left Kan extension persists in the more general case of Grothendieck topologies.
We list here some occurrences of Kan extensions in physics.
But here is a list of some example where they appear rather explicitly.
For this reason, we have above denoted this functor by p *.
This can be unpacked the following way:
is pointed and if the category C has finite limits, then finitely complete
More generally, we can talk about arbitrary limits distributing over colimits.
We recover the above definition when K is a constant functor.
This is because any pullback of a fibration is an exact square.
For sound doctrines (See Section 6 in ABLR.)
In some cases, however, distributivity and commutativity are equivalent.
The same is true for finite products and sifted colimits.
The distributivity of finite products over arbitrary coproducts is the most classical version.
See distributivity for monoidal structures for various generalizations.
See Theorem 5.13 and Lemma 5.14 in ALR.

Thus F defines a subspace F‚äÜ3 X.
Under UP, the product space 3 X is compact Hausdorff.

Let V be a finite-dimensional vector space over some ground field k.
(embedding tensors induce tensor hierarchies)
Note that if R is commutative then (i) implies (UF).
Such spaces include (pseudo)metric spaces and topological groups.
The relationship with gauge spaces (defined below) also allows for another definition.
If U,V are entourages, so is some subset of U‚à©V.
In light of axiom (6), it follows that U‚à©V is an entourage.
If U is an entourage and U‚äÜV‚äÜX√óX, then V is an entourage.
A set equipped with a uniform structure is called a uniform space.
A collection satisfying (1‚Äì3) is a preuniformity.
There is an entourage U‚ààS and elements x‚ààX and y‚ààX such that x‚âà Uy.
An equivalent way to characterize a uniform space is by its collection of uniform covers.
Here a cover of a set X is a collection C‚äÜP(X) with union X.
This defines a bijection between entourage uniformities and covering uniformities.
In classical mathematics, the uniform topology is always regular and indeed completely regular.
There is an obvious concrete category Unif of uniform spaces and uniformly continuous maps.
(One can similarly define a Cauchy filter.
This definition makes a uniform space into a Cauchy space.)
This definition makes a uniform space into a convergence space.)
(This is a purely topological concept.)
This inequality is tight exactly when the uniform space is Hausdorff.
(The other axioms are easy.)
Every quasi(pseudo)metric space is a quasiuniform space in the same way.
We can also generalise from metric spaces to gauge spaces; see under Variations below.
I wonder if that has anything to do with Haar measure?)
In particular, any Banach space or Lie group is a uniform space.
Define x‚âà Uy to mean that x‚ààyU (or y‚ààxU for the other way).
These are in a way the motivating examples.
We can also form certain uniformities on function spaces.
See also the discussion below on the relation with metric and pseudometric spaces.
Of course, this follows from the fact that it is completely regular.
Every uniform space embeds uniformly in a product of pseudometric spaces.
admits a unique uniformity whose corresponding topology is the topology of X.
The entourages of this uniformity are precisely the neighborhoods of the diagonal in X√óX.
Finally, uniform spaces and uniformly continuous maps form a category Unif.
See Isbell, Chapter III, particularly Theorem 26 p46
See Isbell, exercise III.7, p53
This makes the discussion of completions slightly simpler.
Perhaps surprisingly, every topological space is quasiuniformisable.
In weak foundations of mathematics, the theorems above may not be provable.
Altogether, these may be seen as axiomatising the notion of approximate equivalence.
Of course, it is a uniform space just when it is also symmetric.
Axiom 1 says that there is a unique big subset in F X({‚Ä¢}).

This is also called the category of presheaves on ùíû.

And every such value extends to a natural transformation Œ∑.
Moreover this is natural in both a and F. Proof.

To show that these are inverses, first suppose given x:Fa.
Thus, both composites are equal to identities.

There is a Yoneda lemma for (‚àû,1)-categories.
The assumption of naturality is necessary for the Yoneda lemma to hold.

The Yoneda lemma is effectively the reason that Isbell conjugation exists.
This is a fundamental duality that relates geometry and algebra in large part of mathematics.
In Categories for the Working Mathematician MacLane writes that this happened in 1954.
In particular, the notion makes sense in a topos.
Here is an explicit ‚Äòexternal‚Äô proof:
Now consider x<x‚Ä≤, and let a be a generalised element of Œì.
Suppose that x,x‚Ä≤:R both satisfy the required properties, and suppose that x#x‚Ä≤.
Now suppose that x<x‚Ä≤.
It follows that x belongs to L, so x<x.
Therefore, x#x‚Ä≤ is false.
However, the argument works for a geometric Heyting category or a topos.
We usually speak of the RNO, if one exists.
Thus, we still have three different constructions to consider.)
The Dedekind real numbers object of ‚Ñ∞ is the object of all Dedekind cuts.
To be more precise, we will need to make some auxiliary definitions.
We first construct an integers object as follows.
We denote by ùí´(A) the power object of A in ‚Ñ∞.
(Hence, Œî and Œì are the components of a geometric morphism Sh(X)‚ÜíSet.)
However, the finite limits are not necessary; see also below.
In a general sheaf topos We can generalize the above theorem as follows.
We have an induced functor L:S‚ÜíLoc.
We can also regard the ordinary real numbers ‚Ñù as a locale.
There is some dispute about this, see here.
Resolution seems to be here Generalizations Cauchy real numbers

This allows to speak of commutative algebra internal to tensor categories.
Specializing this to the tensor category of super vector spaces yields supercommutative superalgebras.
The formal duals of these are the affine super schemes.
This we discuss in Commutative algebra in tensor categories and Affine super-spaces
This is the category inside which linear algebra takes place.
This is traditionally captured by the following terminology for additive and abelian categories.
Let ùíû be a category.
We write V‚äïW for the direct sum of two objects of ùíû.
Recall the basic construction of the tensor product of vector spaces:
This defines a category, denoted Vect G.
For proof see at monoidal category this lemma and this lemma.
A key such property is commutativity.
We will see below that this is the very source of superalgebra.
As in example , this definition makes ‚Ñ§/2 a monoidal category def. .
(See at looping and delooping).
We write k 1|0 and k 0|1 for these, respectively.
Write LineÀú(Vect ‚Ñ§/2) for the resulting 2-group.
One finds (‚Ä¶) H 4(K(‚Ñ§/2,3),‚Ñ§/2)‚âÉ‚Ñ§/2.
The following is evident but important
, extends to a braided monoidal functor (def. ).
Accordingly, it is also called the internal hom between Y and Z.
Proof Let A‚ààùíû be any object.
In both cases this is a strong monoidal functor (def. )
We now discuss one more extra property on monoidal categories
We say that A * is the right dual object to A.
There are slight variants of what people mean by a ‚Äútensor category‚Äù.
In this form this is considered in (Deligne 02, 0.1).
We consider now various types of size constraints on tensor categories.
Let ùíû be an abelian category.
It has a single isomorphism class of simple objects, namely k itself.
Also category of finite dimensional super vector spaces is a finite tensor category.
The following is the main size constraint needed in the theorem.
The evident example is the following:
This is made precise by def. and ef. below.
This duality between certain spaces and their algebras of functions is profound.
In the physics literature, such spaces are usually just called superspaces.
We now make this precise.
Similarly a commutative monoid in Vect is an ordinary commutative algebra.
Moreover, in both cases the homomorphisms of monoids agree with usual algebra homomorphisms.
Hence there are equivalences of categories.
Example motivates the following definition:
Hence the heart of superalgebra is super-commutativity.
Hence this regards a commutative algebra as a superalgebra concentrated in even degree.
We also call this the affine scheme of A.
We also call this the algebra of functions on X. Definition
See at geometry of physics ‚Äì supergeometry for more on this.
Monoids are preserved by lax monoidal functors:
A key such construction is that of vector bundles over X.
Write Œì X(V) for the set of all such sections.
Observe that this set inherits various extra structure.
This hence yields a new section c 1œÉ 1+c 2œÉ 2.
Hence the set of sections of a vector bundle naturally forms itself a vector space.
But there is more structure.
This operation enjoys some evident properties.
These ‚Äúgeneralized vector bundles‚Äù are called ‚Äúquasicoherent sheaves‚Äù over affines.
We now state the relevant definitions and constructions formally.
The action property holds due to lemma .
Then k[G]-modules in Vect are equivalently linear representations of G. Proposition
The A-modules of this form are called free modules.
This natural bijection between f and fÀú establishes the adjunction.
To that end, we check the universal property of the coequalizer:
Hence the diagram says that œï‚àòŒº=f, which we needed to show.
For that let q:A‚ÜíQ be any other morphism with q‚àòŒº=f.
The commutativity of this diagram says that q=œï.
Then consider the two conditions on the unit e E:A‚ü∂E.
The following says that these may be computed just as the tensor product of modules:
By definition, every tensor category is an abelian category (def. ).
Hence all coequalizers exist, in particlar the split coequalizers required in prop. .
Moreover, by definition every tensor category is a rigid monoidal category.
These are of course the Lie groups.
But here we need to consider groups with more general geometric structure.
The key to the generalization is to regard spaces dually via their algebras of functions.
The resulting algebraic structure is called a Hopf algebra.
The identity morphism (going upwards in the above diagram) is the diagonal.
Observe that here the two morphisms ‚Ñ§[

(We compute the first dozen of these, 2-locally, below.)
These break up computations of stable homotopy groups along chosen filtrations on spectra.
This is the E-Adams spectral sequence which we discuss here.
First we set up the general theory of E-Adams spectral sequences.
(We consider examples and applications further below.)
But for the present purpose we stick with the simpler special case of def. .
There is no condition on the morphisms in def. .
Next we turn to extracting information from this sequence of sequences.
This is straightforward to check.
For completeness we spell it out:
First consider that the morphisms are well defined in the first place.
It is clear that iÀú is well-defined.
That kÀú vanishes on im(d): because im(d)‚äÇim(j) and hence by exactness.
By exactness this is im(i).
The kernel of iÀú is ker(i)‚à©im(i)‚âÉim(k)‚à©im(i), by exactness.
is sometimes called the Boardman homomorphism (Adams 74, p. 58).
where we write E¬Ø p‚âîE¬Ø‚àß‚ãØ‚àßE¬Ø‚èüpfactors‚àßY.
Assume then by induction that it holds for some p‚â•0.
The condition needed for this to work is the following.
First consider the case that X‚âÉŒ£ nùïä is a suspension of the sphere spectrum.
Therefore in this case we have an isomorphism for all E.
Hence the 5-lemma implies that also the middle morphism is an isomorphism.
This shows the claim inductively for all finite CW-spectra.
We now first discuss what this means.
The identity morphism (going upwards in the above diagram) is the diagonal.
All of the following rich structure is directly modeled on this simplistic example.
These two actions need not strictly coincide, but they are isomorphic:
evidently carry a lot of structure.
But it may happen that they coincide:
It is now straightforward, if somewhat tedious, to check that:
A ring which is isomorphic to its core is called a solid ring.
Say that f has degree n if it increases degree by n.
This gives a ‚Ñ§-graded hom-group Hom Œì ‚Ä¢(‚àí,‚àí).
This establishes a natural bijection N‚ü∂fŒì‚äó ACN‚ü∂fÀúC and hence the adjunction in question.
Consider a commutative Hopf algebroid Œì over A, def. .
Regard A itself canonically as a right Œì-comodule via example .
This is the statement of lemma below.
One such case is exhibited by prop. below.
Hence the top horizontal morphism is an isomorphism, which was to be shown.
Consider the composite X‚ü∂‚à®i‚ààIŒ£ |x i|E‚ü∂N 1.
By remark the second page is the cochain cohomology of this complex.
By prop. it is a resolution by cofree comodules (def. ).
That these are F-acyclic is lemma below.
This means that the above long exact sequence collapses to short exact sequences.
The argument for the existence of cokernels proceeds formally dually.
Hence ŒìCoMod is a pre-abelian category.
So the latter is in fact an abelian category itself.
Now by prop. we have the adjunction AMod‚ä•‚ü∂co‚àífree‚üµforgetŒìCoMod.
Hence ŒìCoMod has enough injective objects (def.).
With lemma the proof of theorem is completed.
We give a precise discussion below in Localization and adic completion of abelian groups.
This we review below in Primary decomposition of abelian groups.
We discuss this localization of spectra below in Localization and nilpotent completion of spectra.
Notice that the p i need not all be distinct.
This is equivalently the cyclic group ‚Ñ§/p 1p 2‚Ñ§‚âÉ‚Ñ§/p 1‚Ñ§‚äï‚Ñ§/p 2‚Ñ§.
The isomorphism is given by sending 1 to (p 2,p 1).
The latter is the cyclic group of order p 1 2p 2.
That is, each partition of k yields an abelian group of order p k.
Let K be an abelian group.
Nakayama‚Äôs lemma is frequently stated in a general but slightly unilluminating form.
We begin with an easier and more intuitive form.
In this article, all rings are assumed to be commutative.
Let M be a finitely generated R-module.
Here is a sample application.
Equivalently, that if k‚äó Rf is epic, then f is epic.
Suppose O is a Noetherian local ring.
Being Noetherian, its maximal ideal ùî™ is finitely generated.
Suppose k‚äó Oùî™‚âÖùî™/ùî™ 2 ‚Äì the cotangent space ‚Äì is a vector space of dimension n.
We turn now to a general statement of Nakayama‚Äôs lemma.

For more technical details and further pointers see at string theory.
What is string theory?
(Or rather: its full incarnation remains unknown.
Then why not consider perturbative p-brane scattering for any p?
But the above two problems make a direct such analogy unlikely.
What are the equations of string theory?
But perturbative string theory is not a local field theory.
This is the equation that defines perturbative string theory.
Instead, all there is a formula for the outcome of scattering experiments.
For more on this see at amplituhedron.
Why is string theory controversial?
Notice that if so, this would be quite remarkable.
Then there are two possible standpoints, and they account for the controversy:
Moreover, many of these have good general agreement with presently observed data.
In such a case the field itself serves as an effective cosmological constant.
In string theory this happens with all the parameters.
From the perspective of ‚ÄúM-theory‚Äù even that disappears.
See at string theory ‚Äì scales.)
That is why in string theory instead of adjusting parameters one searches solutions.
But very little is actually known to date.
This fact is what originally led to the strong interest in string theory.
It may be good to compare to established and (essentially) uncontroversial theories.
This model cannot be predicted by the theory of Einstein-gravity.
is well witnessed for instance by the early history of cosmology.
Similar descriptions can be given of the standard model of particle physics.
This, too, makes predictions that have been tested to fantastic accuracy.
But it does so only after lots and lots of parameters have been chosen.
None of this could be derived from first principles of quantum field theory.
In string theory it is just like this.
All other proposals for ‚Äúbeyond the standard model‚Äù physics share this problem.
See at string theory results applied elsewhere for more on this.
So all this was testable, has been tested and turned out to be wrong.
So model building in string theory is much as in QFT.
Was Einstein‚Äôs theory wrong?
No, his model within the theory was wrong.
It‚Äôs fundamentally a trial and error process, after all.
It either makes sense at all energies, or not at all.
They have all been checked to be so only in some approximation.)
The theory does not control it, it‚Äôs a free parameter.
We find that string theory avoids problems with nonlocality in a surprising way.
Does string theory predict supersymmetry?
It would be rather bizarre to live in a spacetime with such a property!
Now supersymmetry refers to a super Lie group extension of the Lorentz group.
(Mathematically this is now the situation of super Cartan geometry.)
Contrary to that, local supersymmetry is rather generic in low dimensions.
(See the references here.)
Ever since the spinning string is called the superstring.
On the other hand, in low worldvolume dimension this tends to be inevitable.
What is a string vacuum?
This is then called a perturbative string theory vacuum.
But this is in general a coarse approximation.
How/why does string theory depend on ‚Äúbackgrounds‚Äù?
The series itself represents the original function restricted to the formal neighbourhood of that point.
Such a solution is also called a vacuum or a background of the quantum theory.
By design, all this applies also to perturbative string theory.
But this remains a conjecture.
Consistency arguments for this speculation have been given in (Witten xy).
Did string theory provide any insight relevant in experimental particle physics?
One of this has led to recent progress simply in computational tools of perturbation series.
Details on this are linked to at string theory results applied elsewhere.
(Seiberg duality for instance, long list will go here‚Ä¶)
But this is a bit like a soccer match with a pingpong ball.
What would be needed here is an understanding of non-perturbative string theory.
More on how this works is at black holes in string theory.
But if so, it has not surfaced so far.
What is the relationship between string theory and quantum field theory?
So the two are different.
It turns out that only rather special ones do.
(Sometimes people forget what it takes to defined a full 2d CFT.
Isn‚Äôt it fatal that the string perturbation series does not converge?
Nevertheless, the sum over all these contributions diverges.
Does this mean that perturbative string theory is unrealistic from the get go?
See at non-perturbative effect for more.
How do strings model massive particles?
In string phenomenology therefore all fundamental particles correspond to ground state excitations of strings.
How is string theory related to the theory of gravity?
Do the extra dimensions lead to instability of 4 dimensional spacetime?
This problem used to be open until around 2002.
Since these are generically topologically complicated, they have comparatively large numbers of cycles.

A familiar kind of closed categories are closed monoidal categories.

These should correspond to symmetric multicategories.
They should correspond to cartesian multicategories.
Thus closed categories are essentially equivalent to closed unital multicategories.

In particular they make sense in the context of supergeometry.
This means that they carry natural intrinsic torsion of a G-structure.
For more on this see also at torsion constraints of supergravity.
In particular super-Minkowski spacetimes carry non-trivial exceptional super Lie algebra cocycles.
This is the origin of much of higher Cartan geometry within super-Cartan geometry.
(In part I These authors speak of ‚ÄòPoincar√© gravity‚Äô.
More general super-Cartan geometry apparently remains to be explored.
Recall the following from the discussion at geometry of physics ‚Äì smooth sets.
We will set up supergeometry in direct analogy to this formulation of plain differential geometry.

Write SuperCAlg ‚Ñù for the category of commutative superalgebras over ‚Ñù. Definition
We write ‚Ñù p|q‚ààSuperCartSp for the formal dual of C ‚àû(‚Ñù p|q).
Write SuperSmooth0Type‚âîSh(SuperCartSp) for the sheaf topos over that site.
We call this the collection of smooth super spaces.
This is the topos that hosts traditional supergeometry.
It will be useful to make this explicit.
We call this the category of infinitesimally thickened points.
The sheaf topos FormalSmooth0Type‚âîSh(CartSp‚ãäInfPoint) is traditionally known as the Cahiers topos.
Write ùîª for the formal dual of the algebra of dual numbers.
But derivations of algebras of smooth functions are equivalent to vector fields.
(See at derivations of smooth functions are vector fields).
We call this the category of infinitesimally thickened superpoints.
The further right adjoint R is the rheonomy modality.
For convenience, from now on we notationally abbreviate: H‚âîSuperFormalSmooth0Type.
We pronounce the operations in corollary as follows.
This is the input for the formulation of frame bundles below around prop. .
There are some further relations between the modalities to take note of:
This we get to below.
Below in Super Cartan geometry we then specify to the concrete particular super Cartan geometry.
Finally ‚áù preserves pullbacks (being in particular a right adjoint).
See also at geometry of physics ‚Äì G-structure and Cartan geometry.
We call this the left invariant G-structure.
Consider any group homomorphism G‚ÜíGL(V).
Indeed, this is a phenomenon known as the torsion constraints in supergravity.
This we come to now in Super-Cartan geometry for Supergravity.
This statement is the Bianchi identity.
Now to pass this to superalgebra.
Accordingly we write Œ© 1(‚Ñù p|q,ùî§)‚âîHom dgAlg(W(ùî§),Œ© ‚Ä¢(‚Ñù p|q)).
This issue is deal with by the concept of rheonomy.
We consider now very specific super Lie algebras, def. , those of supersymmetry.
Such structure exists on real spin representation:
The following table lists the irreducible real spin representations of Spin(V).
We may conceptualize this as follows:
These relation consistute CE(‚Ñù d‚àí1,1|N).

A rich source of traditional Cartan geometry comes from special holonomy induced by definite forms.
First consider the traditional situation Definition

Entourages are actually a uniformization of neighbourhoods rather than of open sets as such.
The precise definition depends on the context.

So handle with care for the moment.
It is similar in spirit to factorization algebras, blob homology and topological chiral homology.

It is something of a misnomer because it is really a condition about antichains.
A Heyting algebra H satisfies the countable chain condition iff Reg(H) does.
Let B be a complete Boolean algebra.
It is straightforward to verify that these assignments are inverse to one another.
Next we will need a result in combinatorial set theory.
Let ùíú be an uncountable collection of finite sets.
Then there is some uncountable subset ‚Ñ¨‚äÜùíú that is a sunflower.
Without loss of generality, we may suppose all A‚ààùíú have the same cardinality n.
We argue by induction on n.
The case n=0 is trivial.
Assume the result holds for n, and suppose |A|=n+1 for all A‚ààùíú.
Then induction goes through by forming the sunflower {B+{a}:B‚àà‚Ñ¨‚Ä≤}.
Otherwise, each a‚ààX belongs to at most countably many A‚ààùíú.

With this the proof is complete.
An arbitrary product of separable spaces X i satisfies the countable chain condition.
second-countable: there is a countable base of the topology.
metrisable: the topology is induced by a metric.
separable: there is a countable dense subset.
Lindel√∂f: every open cover has a countable sub-cover.
metacompact: every open cover has a point-finite open refinement.
first-countable: every point has a countable neighborhood base
second-countable spaces are Lindel√∂f.
weakly Lindel√∂f spaces with countably locally finite base are second countable.
separable metacompact spaces are Lindel√∂f.
Lindel√∂f spaces are trivially also weakly Lindel√∂f.
a first-countable space is obviously Fr√©chet-Urysohn.
a Fr√©chet-Uryson space is obviously sequential.
a sequential space is obviously countably tight.
paracompact spaces satisfying the countable chain condition are Lindel√∂f.

In particular, this implies that each X r is cofibrant in M.
For some M, M R also admits a projective or injective model structures.

The next few propositions develop properties of conjugation.
For all w we have ‚ü®u¬Øv¬Ø,w‚ü©=‚ü®v¬Ø,uw‚ü©=‚ü®v¬Øw¬Ø,u‚ü©=‚ü®w¬Ø,vu‚ü©=‚ü®vu¬Ø,w‚ü© using involution and unitarity.
The result follows from nondegeneracy of the form.
This last result has several interesting corollaries.
N(u)=0 implies u is a zero divisor, with u¬Øu=0.
The other equation is proven similarly.
For discussion of this in composition algebras, see the section on Moufang identities below.
We begin with a simple observation:
This Œ± is invertible, so Œ±‚ãÖW has the same dimension as W.
Indeed, Œ±W is orthogonal to W.
It follows that W+Œ±W has double the dimension of W.
Now let us fix such an Œ±, and put Œª=N(Œ±).
It follows that the form on V, when restricted to W+Œ±W, is nondegenerate.
Indeed, the possible structures of composition algebras are very tightly constrained.
These identities, combined with nondegeneracy of the form, give the result.
Possible dimensions are 1, 2, 4, and 8.
Then W is an associative composition algebra.
Suppose V=W+Œ±W is an associative composition algebra.
Then W is a commutative, associative composition algebra.
Suppose V=W+Œ±W is a commutative associative composition algebra.
Hence the doubling process may be iterated three times at most.
This same result can also be proven using string diagram calculus.
See this paper for a nice exposition of that route.
If so, then the composition algebra is called a split composition algebra.
We analyze each in turn.
, the result is immediate since N(rv+se)=r 2N(v)+s 2‚â•0
In particular, any division composition algebra is a normed division algebra.
We have the following possibilities.
The conjugate of s+jt is s‚àíjt. dim(V)=4.
(Evidently V is not commutative because W is not purely real.)
Conjugation is given by the usual operation a+bi+cj+dk‚Ü¶a‚àíbi‚àícj‚àídk dim(V)=8.
(V is not associative because W is not commutative.)
Thus, we have established the Hurwitz theorem Theorem (Hurwitz)
Now we turn to split composition algebras V.
Suppose V=W+Œ±W, where Œ±‚ààW ‚ä•, N(Œ±)‚â†0.
Put j=Œ±/|N(Œ±)| 1/2, so |N(j)|=1, V=W+jW.
In addition to the trivial 1-dimensional case, we have the following possibilities.
The norm of an element xe 1+ye 2 is N(xe 1+ye 2)=xy. dim(V)=4.
Let i be an imaginary unit of W, so i¬Ø=‚àíi and |N(i)|=1.
In other words, (uv)(wu)=(u(vw))(eu)=(u(vw))u,(uv)(wu)=(ue)((vw)u)=u((vw)u) which completes the proof.

The category of numerical motives is a semisimple abelian category.

Since œÄ is epic, P(f)=0 follows.
For some finite n‚â•0, we have a surjective map p:R n‚ÜíV.

Such functors are called presheaves.
Equivalently this may be thought of as a contravariant functor F:C‚ÜíSet.
Hence ‚Äúpresheaf‚Äù is a concept with an attitude.
As such, it is an example of a functor category.
The Yoneda embedding sends each object c‚ààC to the presheaf F(‚àí)=hom(‚àí,c)

This is often written with some convenient abuse of notation as F‚âÉcolim V‚ÜíFV.
Then rephrasing this, Œ± specifies a function F(V)‚ÜíB(V).
The naturality of this assignment is guaranteed by the naturality of the map Œ±.

In ordinary category theory, any comma square is always exact.
Exact squares can be characterized in several ways, which generalize in different directions.
Note that D(1,g)‚àòD(v,1)‚âÖD(v,g) by Yoneda reduction.
However, in the Set-based case, we can go further.
We can state this equivalently as follows.
This is the standard combinatorial characterization of a final functor.
Another approach is to argue as follows.
(Note that this ejects us from the world of enriched categories already.)
So the given square is exact just when all of these squares are exact.
See (May, theorem 8.4).

Its Lie algebroid is the Atiyah Lie algebroid at(P) of P.
We describe two of them.
the functor At(P)‚ÜíPair(X) is the unique one that is the identity on objects.
The concept was introduced in (Makkai 96).
There is no connection to the concept of cartesian bicategory.
Many interval objects are cocategory objects.
For example, the arrow category is a cocategory object in Cat.
Any coalgebra object is a cocategory object.
This includes corings, Hopf algebroids, cogroupoids?, etc.
These represent the discrete category functor and the codiscrete category functors Set‚ÜíCat, respectively.
This situation is discussed at distributivity of limits over colimits.
Exponentiability is a local property:
If a Grothendieck topos ‚Ñ∞ is exponentiable so is ‚Ñ∞/X for any object X‚àà‚Ñ∞.
This occurs as lemma 4.2 in Johnstone-Joyal (1982, p.281).
Continuity also leaves a lattice-theoretic trace:
This occurs as lemma 5.1 in Johnstone-Joyal (1982, p.287).
This includes in particular all presheaf toposes on small categories.
An example of the latter is the Sierpinski topos ùíÆ 2.
Now consider an arbitrary topos ‚Ñ∞ classifying a geometric theory ùïã.
Compare also the remarks of Anel (2015) on the ‚àû-case.
(More generally, the dual theory of any dualizable theory is itself dualizable.)

So in combinatorial group theory we consider a presentation ‚ü®X‚à£R‚ü© of a group G.
We now drop the assumption that P is free.
Then Œ∏ is a P-morphism: Œ∏(w p)=Œ∏(w) p for all w‚ààF P(R),p‚ààP.
Note that Œ∏([[u,v]])=1‚ààF P(R).
This construction is called the free crossed module on œâ:R‚ÜíP.

The statement for the limit is corollary 3.3.3.4.
This corresponds to a non-trivial field of gravity.
Now, assume that n>1.
It is easily seen that (xn) n=x and x nn=x.
It is easily seen that (xn) n=x and x nn=x.
Each of these could be called a real ‚Äúnth root function‚Äù.
Let P be a poset with directed joins.
This characterization generalizes directly to the notion of continuous category.
(These always preserve the order; that is, they are monotone functions.)
For more, see filter monad.
This category was used by Dana Scott to construct models of the untyped lambda calculus.
Every continuous lattice is a Baire lattice.
This is equivalently to being an exponentiable in the category of locales.
The zero object itself is not simple, as it has only one quotient object.
It is too simple to be simple.
An object which is a direct sum of simple objects is called a semisimple object.
A simple group is a simple object in Grp.

The prime geodesic theorem is analogous to the prime number theorem.
Let Œì‚âîœÄ 1(X) be its fundamental group.
For each element Œ≥‚ààŒì there exists one closed geodesic in X representing it.
By standard convenient abuse of notation we write Œ≥ also for that geodesic.
Pivotal categories have also been called ‚Äúsovereign categories.‚Äù
This is a kind of category with duals.
For this isomorphism to be natural we need a pivotal structure.
This can be made explicit, and gives an alternative definition of pivotal.
We graphically define the distinguished morphisms
The following properties are satisfied: These morphisms satisfy the rigidity axioms.
This gives a bijection between pivotal categories and rigid categories with duals satisfying these axioms.
See Bartlett Section 5.1.
However, there is no a-priori reason for a pivotal structure to exist.
[Deligne] Let ùíû be a braided rigid monoidal category.
This conjecture was proposed in their seminal work, On fusion categories.
Roughly, completeness is expressed as ability to integrate with respect to Radon measures.
Then œï is a regular automorphism, i.e. has a polynomially defined inverse.

In low dimensions the results are ‚Äòold‚Äô or ‚Äòclassical‚Äô.
We will consider connected cases (simplicial groups) only.
For the non pointed case, we can say groupoids form an algebraic model.
Finding the algebraic model for the n-types is just a start.
Ideally one searches for algebraic models of all the higher homotopy structure as well.
One of his most widely followed models is that of stable homotopy theory.
H.-J. Baues has followed up many of the latter ideas.
It is sensible to regard crossed complexes as giving a linear model of homotopy types.

On combinatorial model categories: Universal Homotopy Theories Combinatorial model categories have presentations
This assignment is called the parallel transport of the connection.
This may be equivalently but more succinctly be formulated as follows:
We say diffeological groupoid for an internal groupoid in the category of diffeological spaces.
Moreover, this functor uniquely characterizes the connection on P that it comes from.
This means that we may identify connections on P with their parallel transport functors.
But even the bundle P itself is encoded in such functors.
Its morphisms are full homotopy-classes of paths.
In terms of this, parallel transport is a solution to a differential equation.
This is called a path-ordered integral.
The ‚ÄúP‚Äù in the above formula is short for ‚Äúpath ordering‚Äù.
Possibly this notation originates in physics where the above is known as the Dyson formula.
See higher parallel transport for details.
There are many equivalent statements of the ordinary definition of a connection on a bundle.

Any 2-category has a bicategory of maps.
Consequently, the bicategory of maps of an allegory is a category.
These constructions are inverse, so tabular allegories are equivalent to locally regular categories.
Thus, regular categories are equivalent to unital (or unitary) tabular allegories.
Thus a union allegory is locally a lattice.
If additionally it is locally a distributive lattice, it is called a distributive allegory.
But in either case the adjunction i‚ä£P is fundamental.
The exact definition of power allegory is a matter for consideration.

I‚Äôll implement my categorical coproduct in the programming language Python 3.0.
But most importantly, Python supports functional programming.
As a start, this shows Python evaluating simple arithmetic expressions.
I can call a function.
This is where it begins getting interesting.
Below, I put the function exp into the variable myfunc.
By the way, lambda expressions arose as part of the lambda calculus.

Use a dict with source, target, and body fields.]
Now I‚Äôll show the definition of coproduct again:

The rational numbers ‚Ñö are a prefield ring.

Let F be a discrete field and let F¬Ø be the algebraic closure of F.
Non-example: the integers ‚Ñ§ are not a prefield ring.
Bertrand‚Äôs postulate is the following.
We record the proof (of the formulation in Remark ).
Without loss of generality, suppose that p 1 has this property.
Suppose instead that n is prime.
Then n+1 is composite, since it must be divisible by 2.
Without loss of generality, suppose that p 1‚Ä≤ has this property.
Moreover, p 1‚Ä≤ is not equal to 2n, since 2n is not prime.
We deduce that p 1‚Ä≤<2n, as required.

Actual re-normalization is the the change of such normalizations.

This is shown in (Brunetti-Fredenhagen 00, p. 24).
This is essentially (H√∂rmander 90, thm. 3.2.4).
Therefore to conclude it is now sufficient to show that deg(u‚àòp œÅ^)=œÅ.
This is shown in (Brunetti-Fredenhagen 00, p. 25).

The condition ‚Äúperturbation‚Äù is immediate from the corresponding condition on ùíÆ and ùíÆ‚Ä≤.

In conclusion this establishes the following pivotal statement of perturbative quantum field theory:
Typically one imposes a set of renormalization conditions (def. )

We proceed by induction over n‚àà‚Ñï.

In this case the choice of ("re"-)normalization hence ‚Äúflows with scale‚Äù.

Idea A supermanifold is a space locally modeled on Cartesian spaces and superpoints.
There are different approaches to the definition and theory of supermanifolds in the literature.
The definition As locally ringed spaces is popular.
See at geometry of physics ‚Äì supergeometry the section Supermanifolds.
With the obvious morphisms of ringed space this forms the category SDiff of supermanifolds.
This is usually denoted by Œ†E. Example
But we have the following useful characterization of morphisms of supermanifolds:
Let SuperPoint be the category of superpoints.
See (Sachse) and the references at super ‚àû-groupoid.
See also this post at Theoretical Atlas.
This appears as (Sachse, def. 4.6).
We now want to describe supermanifolds as manifolds in SuperSet modeled on superdomains.
Write SmoothMfd for the category of ordinary smooth manifolds.
This appears as (Sachse, def. 4.13, 4.14).

Idea Schur‚Äôs lemma is one of the fundamental facts of representation theory.
It concerns basic properties of the hom-sets between irreducible linear representations of groups.
Let G be a group.
It follows that the endomorphism ring of an irreducible representation is a division ring.

A multiset is like a set, just allowing that the elements have multiplicities.
Multisets are useful in combinatorics.
A multiset is locally finite if multiplicity takes values in the natural numbers.
The multiset is finite if it is locally finite and X is a finite set.
The cardinality of a multiset is given by |ùí≥|=‚àë e‚ààXŒº X(e).
Note that the inner product corresponds to the cardinality of the product ‚ü®ùí≥,ùí¥‚ü©=|ùí≥ùí¥|.

See also at locally presentable categories - introduction.
There are many equivalent characterizations of locally presentable categories.
The following is one of the most intuitive, equivalent characterizations are discussed below.
A locally ‚Ñµ 0-presentable category is called a locally finitely presentable category.
This is Ad√°mek & Rosick√Ω (1994), corollary 1.52.
For the more detailed statement see below at Gabriel-Ulmer duality.
Locally presentable categories are complete.
Every locally presentable category is also well-copowered.
So all finite sets are ?0-compact.
TopologicalSpaces is not locally finitely presentable.
This is Gabriel-Ulmer, Satz 7.13.
They are important for the general study of (‚àû,1)-categories.
This implies that all representables in a sheaf topos are Œ∫-compact objects.
This appears in Ad√°mek & Rosick√Ω (1994), 2.78.
This is Ad√°mek & Rosick√Ω (1994), Cor. 1.54
See at Functor category ‚Äì Local presentability for more.
This appears for instance as Centazzo-Rosick√Ω-Vitale, remark 3.
Another notion of ‚Äúpresentable category‚Äù is that of an equationally presentable category.
Locally presentable categories are a special case of locally bounded categories.
Cocomplete possibly-large categories generated under filtered colimits by small generators under small relations.
This hence relates entailment in the metalanguage with implication in the object language.
This point, if unique, is called the center of rotation.
This line or plane is called the axis of rotation.
The rotation in 2d is determined by its center and the oriented angle of rotation.
The restriction of a rotation to this subspace is a rotation of the plane.
(Orientation should be discussed here.)
The group of rotations is SO(3,R), below just called SO(3).
The composition of rotations corresponds to the multiplication of quaternions.
The structure focuses on the events and the causal ordering between them.
A restricted but simpler definition is as follows:
Event structures with binary conflict can be characterised as follows: Proposition
We write E for (E,‚â§,Con) whenever possible.
The possible states of an event structures are called configurations.
Let E be an event structure.
The set of finite configurations of E is denoted ùíû(E).

With some care, we can remove the restriction to small categories.)
From a structural perspective, however, this is unnecessary.)
More commentary on this in more general contexts will be given below.

For example, the category CG of compactly generated spaces is coreflective in Top.
Products in C op are given by coproducts in C.
In some cases, this formal tautology gives the only sensible way to construct products.

This article is about the general concept of branes.
In an open-closed QFT the cobordisms are allowed to have boundaries.
See at boundary field theory for more on this.
But abstractly defined QFTs may arise from quantization of sigma models.
This gives these boundary data a geometric interpretation in some space.
This we discuss in the next section.
Particularly the A-model and the B-model are well understood.
And typically these submanifolds themselves carry their own background gauge field data.
These may be quite far from having a direct interpretation as submanifolds of G.
In string theory one speaks apart from the D-branes also about fundamental branes .

These are the differential forms on spaces in logarithmic geometry.
They form the logarithmic generalization of the holomorphic de Rham complex.
So let S be a set.
It is denoted ‚Ñµ(S).
There are other ways to encode ‚Ñµ(S).
This in turn implies x<x, a contradiction.
If dom(R)=Œ∫ +, then R witnesses Œ∫ +‚â§Œ±.
Iterated power sets of X also have that property.
To show this, we need a spot of cardinal arithmetic in ZF.
Granting the claim, let us continue.
By GCH, one of those two inequalities is an equality.

Certainly homotopy theory (up to weak homotopy equivalence) needs only Hausdorff spaces.
Here is a classically equivalent definition that is more suitable for constructive mathematics:
This is the mundane way of saying that = is closed in S√óS.
See Beyond topological spaces below for more.
That is, convergence in a Hausdorff space is unique.
Proposition a CW-complex is a Hausdorff space.
Here we just briefly indicate the corresponding lifting diagrams.
There are various ways to see the existence and to construct the Hausdorff reflection.
That this is well defined and continuous follows directly from the definitions.
What remains to be seen is that HX is indeed a Hausdorff space.
Hence assume that [x]‚â†[y]‚ààHX.
Proposition compact subspaces of Hausdorff spaces are closed.
Proposition maps from compact spaces to Hausdorff spaces are closed and proper
Here is a proof in the language of category theory:
Alternatively, here is a proof in the language of basic topology:
With classical logic we may equivalently show the contrapositive: That f‚â†g implies f‚àòi‚â†g‚àòi.
So assume that f‚â†g.
This means that there exists x‚ààX with f(x)‚â†g(x).
This means that f‚àòi‚â†g‚àòi.
Some forms of predicative mathematics find this concept more useful.
The reader can now easily define a sequentially R 1 space.
This also is formally similar to notions such as a separated scheme etc.
For schemes see separated morphism of schemes.
As a simple example, consider a discrete space X regarded as a locale.
That is, X is spatially weakly Hausdorff.
Now let U=‚àÖ and V={(x,x)‚à£x‚ààX}.
I don‚Äôt know what it means for X to be localically weakly Hausdorff.
(Weak closure in locales is very inexplicit.)
This shows that U is #-open.
Since we are done if x#y, it suffices to assume y‚ààU and x‚ààV.
For n=1 this yields the notion of strongly connected topos.

A homomorphism of C *-algebras is a map that preserves all this structure.
For this it is sufficient for it to be a star-algebra homomorphisms.
C *-algebras with these homomorphisms form a category C*Alg.
However, we now usually interpret ‚ÄòC *-algebra‚Äô abstractly.
C *-algebras are monadic over sets.
See also operator algebras.
Many C *-algebras arise as groupoid algebras of Lie groupoids.
For more see at homotopical structure on C*-algebras.
In particular M n(‚ÑÇ) is a C *-algebra for all n‚àà‚Ñï.
This algebra is denoted C 0(X,A)‚ààC *Alg.
If A=‚ÑÇ then one usually just writes C 0(X)‚âîC 0(X,‚ÑÇ).
This are the C *-algebras to which the Gelfand duality theorem applies.

From this starting point one can naturally generalize to more general relative situations.
Consider any non-trivial invertible sheaf ‚Ñí in Pic(T).
Here we list several of the common forms:
They are all isomorphisms if f has a section.

Every cocompact regular space is a Baire space.
A metrisable space is topologically complete if and only if it is cocompact.
These aspects have been developed primarily by Michael Makkai.
In FOLDS these are called simple categories.
The objects that are not relation symbols are called kinds.
However, in a relaxed premodel category, these are trivial cofibrations.
An advantage of the latter is that Œ£ becomes a compact regular locale.
Various statements about operator algebra then have geometric analogs in ùíØ A.

Recall that a topological space is a set X equipped with a topological structure ùíØ.
Unlike with bialgebras, no compatibility condition is required between these structures.
Bitopological spaces and bicontinuous maps form a category BiTop.
Hence Cl *(U) is a ùíØ *-neighborhood of x.
For the converse suppose property (4).
This set is obviously a ùíØ *-closed ùíØ-neighborhood of x.
This is the neighborhood we sought.
Let (X,ùíØ,ùíØ *) be a bitopological space.
Let (X,ùíØ,ùíØ *) be a bitopological space.
The space (X,ùíØ *) is also called a cospace of (X,ùíØ.

Not to be confused with the notion of coherence space in models of linear logic.
A coherent space is Hausdorff if and only if it is a Stone space.
Assuming the axiom of choice, coherent locales are automatically spatial.
The category of coherent locales is contravariantly equivalent to the category of distributive lattices.
The reader can probably think of other variations on this theme.
In other words, the sheafification a j commutes with pseudo-complementation.

This is a special case of an absolute colimit.
The most common example is a split coequalizer.

An first-order integrable almost Hermitian structure is a K√§hler manifold structure.
The polycategorical compositions are obtained using the distributors.
Conversely, a polycategory that is suitably ‚Äúrepresentable‚Äù yields a linearly distributive category.
Note that such examples are almost never star-autonomous.
These examples satisfy the extra property that the distributors Œ¥ are isomorphisms.
Linear bicategories are a horizontal categorification of linearly distributive categories.

This identification leads to a very fruitful identification of operations on types with logical operations.
(For instance, Coq and Agda are concrete machine implementations of such a language.
From this perspective, type theory provides a formal language for speaking about categories.
Type theory with such identity types properly implemented is thus called homotopy type theory.
It is a calculus now for (‚àû,1)-category theory.
See there for more details on this.
But by nature it is more general.
(An introduction and historical background is for instance in Taylor section 2.)
This interpretation can be called categorical semantics.
This is discussed in detail at relation between type theory and category theory.
The syntactic constructs corresponding to objects and morphisms are called types and terms, respectively.
Now suppose in particular that D=* is the terminal object.
This is reflected in the type-theoretic rules for the dependent sum.
This right adjoint exists in any locally cartesian closed category ùíû.
How does type theory relate to logic?
Well, propositional logic is just the type theory whose semantic categories are posets.
Another way of describing this setup is as the subobject fibration cod:Sub(C)‚ÜíC.
The functors ‚àÉ œÄ and ‚àÄ œÄ interpret the traditional existential and universal quantifiers.
Either one is called a ‚Äúmodel‚Äù of T in C.
Note that in general, the following definitions are mutually recursive.
A typing declaration is something of the form t:A.
Most of the most interesting rules involve forming new types.
Of course, this raises the question‚Äîwhat is the type of Type?
The original dependent type theory was Martin-L√∂f dependent type theory.
See, for instance, pure type systems and the calculus of constructions.
This corresponds to the syntax described above.
See the section on Extensional vs Intensional type theory, below.
Otherwise it is first-order.
(We have to deal with Prop specially in first-order logic.
You might as well say that 1 makes things higher-order because 1‚âÖP0.
The second-order version of Peano Arithmetic has this property.
However, without modification, this naive idea fails for two reasons.
First of all, there might not be enough ground terms.
But this doesn‚Äôt work for most other theories.
Does the relation ‚àÖ‚àà{‚àÖ|œÜ} hold in the term model?
We have to make an arbitrary choice.
There is an important distinction between extensional type theories and intensional ones.
We say instead that these function types are intensional.
Per Martin-L√∂f‚Äòs original dependent type theory is often presented from this perspective.
This matches the above observations about the axiom of choice.
I‚Äôm not sure that that‚Äôs so strange.
And I didn‚Äôt know that about COSHEP, why is that?
We merely have that the free set on that preset is projective if it exists.
You're right about the display maps; that part's not so strange.

For a more general concept see at dualizing object.
Note that we do not in general assume D‚ààùíû D.
Specifically in homological algebra one speaks also of dualizing modules.
If ùíû=ùíû D, we say that D is a global dualizing object.

Let A be a commutative (Hausdorff) topological group.
In solid state physics this example appears in the guise of the Brillouin torus.
In general, the dual of a discrete group is a compact group and conversely.
In particular, therefore, the dual of a finite group is again finite.
The finite cyclic groups are Pontrjagin self-dual: ‚Ñ§/n^‚âÉ‚Ñ§/n.
For example: If A is finite, then A^ is finite.
If A is compact, then A^ is discrete.
(see also at nearby homomorphisms from compact Lie groups are conjugate)
If A is discrete, then A^ is compact.
If A is compactly generated, then A^ is a Lie group.
If A is second countable, then A^ is second countable.
If A is separable, then A^ is metrizable.

Now we invoke the following results:
We claim that the morphisms in W¬Ø form a calculus of fractions.
This shows that W¬Ø satisfies the first condition at factorization system.
This demonstrates the adjunction (L‚ä£i).
By the above proposition this is ‚ãØ‚âÉSh C(L(j(U)),L(X)).
One such application is called the plus construction.

Therefore these are local isomorphisms.

An L ‚àû-algebra that is concentrated in lowest degree is an ordinary Lie algebra.
From another perspective: an L ‚àû-algebra is a Lie ‚àû-algebroid with a single object.
See Sati-Schreiber-Stasheff 08, around def. 13.
In the following we spell out in detail what this means in components.
So in this case the L ‚àû-algebra is equivalently a dg-Lie algebra.
The higher Jacobi identity is equivalently the condition that D 2=0.
We now spell out this dg-coalgebraic incarnation of L ‚àû-algebras.
(In general this corresponds to curved L-infinity algebra.
Here we take t a to be of the same degree as t a.
Therefore this derivation has degree +1.

Once that is done, the rest of the identification is straightforward.
In general, however, the two concepts are not equivalent.
There exist similar single-sorted definitions of n-categories and ‚àû-categories.

Then the unit coideal of Œì is the cokernel Œì¬Ø‚âîcoker(A‚ü∂Œ∑Œì).

Idea An absolute pushout is a pushout which is preserved by any functor whatsoever.
See absolute colimit for more.
Equivalently, since the Yoneda embedding is the free cocompletion of C:
We propose the following notion of split pushout.
See Isaacson, Def. 3.22.
Split pushouts are absolute pushouts
To that end consider, a cone under the span (p,q):
We must verify that b also factors as b=(bu)m.
This produces the desired factorization.
Finally, since m is an epimorphism, such factorizations are unique.
However, arbitrary functors do not preserve epimorphisms.
Define x=bu:P‚ÜíX.
Conversely, suppose the given square is an absolute pushout.
Thus, in particular the induced square is a pushout in Set.
Now the induced square is also a pushout in Set.
Unraveling this explicitly produces the morphisms r i,s i.
This gives another proof that any split pushout is an absolute pushout.
Conversely, f is called the adjunct of fÀú.
The converse formula follows analogously.
The argument for the naturality of œµ is directly analogous.
Hence it remains to show the converse.
In one direction, assume a left adjoint L is given.
Then the statement that this really is a universal arrow is implied by Prop. .
In the other direction, assume that universal arrows Œ∑ c are given.

This in turn is the case if C‚ãÜ LD‚âÉ(D op‚ãÜ R opC op) op.
We say that C‚ãÜ kD is the cograph of the functor k.
See there for more on this.
Consequently, this description is not viable for enriched adjunctions.
This description generalises to relative adjunctions by replacing Id C with J.
This follows from the fact that the adjunction L‚ä£R induces adjunctions ‚àí‚àòR‚ä£‚àí‚àòL and L‚àò‚àí‚ä£R‚àò‚àí.
The other case is directly analogous.
Suppose that R 1,R 2:ùíû‚Üíùíü are two functors which are right adjoint to L.
The argument that shows the preservation of colimits by L is analogous.
A partial converse to Prop. is provided by the adjoint functor theorem.
See also Pointwise Expression below.
So L is faithful precisely if all x‚ÜíRLx are monos.
The proof of the other statements proceeds analogously.
Parts of this statement can be strengthened:
This appears as (Johnstone, lemma 1.1.1).
By the Eckmann-Hilton argument the endomorphism monoid of Id D is commutative.
First assume that the left adjoint exist.
We need to show that this yields a left adjoint.
But this follows directly from the limit formulas (9) and (10).
See at adjoint functor theorem for more.
Proof We verify only that we obtain a monad.
(1) We know that this diagram commutes:
The latter is called the monadic adjunction.
Dually, right Kan extensions along R are given by precomposition with L.
Dually, right Kan lifts along L are given by postcomposition with R.
[[!include sliced adjoint functors ‚Äì section]]
The central point about examples of adjoint functors is: Adjoint functors are ubiquitous .
But any list is necessarily wildly incomplete.
A pair of adjoint functors between posets is a Galois correspondence.
In this case L may be regarded as a localization.
These are one kind of morphisms between toposes.
If in addition R is full and faithful, then this is a geometric embedding.
Let H be a cohesive (‚àû,1)-topos.

By cohesion the left vertical map is an equivalence.
The claim now follows with the homotopy fiber characterization of homotopy pullbacks.

Nearly every construction in differential topology starts with tangent or cotangent bundles.
We shall look at how one could define these in the more general setting.
(However in MR1471480, only operational tangent vectors have higher orders.
Let us start with kinematic tangent vectors.
We start with a notion of what it means for a curve to be flat.
It is flat at t‚àà‚Ñù if it is k-flat for all k‚àà‚Ñï.
Let (X,ùíû,‚Ñ±) be a Fr√∂licher space.
For Euclidean spaces with their usual structure, all of these tangent sets coincide.
Let (X,ùíû,‚Ñ±) be a Fr√∂licher space.
It is obvious that each of these kinematic tangent sets is functorial in Fr√∂licher spaces.
Let X be a Fr√∂licher space, x‚ààX.
Lemma Sums are unique if they exist.
The construction of kinematic tangent vectors suggests a similar construction for cotangent vectors.
As with tangent vectors, we need an auxiliary definition of flatness.
Let (X,ùíû,‚Ñ±) be a Fr√∂licher space, x‚ààX.
It is flat at x‚ààX if it is k-flat for all k‚àà‚Ñï.
Again, for convenience we will say that all functionals are 0-flat.
Let (X,ùíû,‚Ñ±) be a Fr√∂licher space, x‚ààX.
There are obvious pairings between kinematic tangent and cotangent vectors based on evaluation.
We can also define operational tangent vectors.
Recall that ‚Ñ± is an algebra of functions.
Let (X,ùíû,‚Ñ±) be a Fr√∂licher space, x‚ààX.
An operational tangent vector at x is a derivation at x of ‚Ñ±.
This has the required properties.

The proof of lemma is given at topological vector bundle here.

We discuss some useful consequences of the long exact sequences in cohomology.
Then there is an isomorphism KÀú(X‚à®Y)‚âÉKÀú(X)‚äïKÀú(Y).
This proves the claim.
Alternatively, we may again argue directly from the long exact sequence:
Consider the subspace inclusion X‚äÇX‚à®Y.
In particular these maps are injections and surjections, respectively.
Let X and Y be topological spaces.

While ‚Äòsimple graph‚Äô is unambiguous, the other terms above are not.
In all four of the above, edges are interpreted as unordered pairs.
(See also Kock (2016a) for further discussion.)
An orientation of an undirected graph is the choice of a direction for every edge.
Any orientation of an undirected graph induces a corresponding directed graph E +‚áâV.
A graph is finite if V and E are both finite sets.
Two graphs G and G‚Ä≤ are isomorphic if there exists such an isomorphism.
Either way, an isomorphism (as defined above) is precisely an invertible morphism.
A usual definition of subgraph in combinatorics is, roughly: subset.
Let G be a graph with vertex set V and edge set E.
(Although obviously, not all graph-theoretic properties are preserved.
For example, barycentric subdivision always produces a bipartite graph).
But no, they prefer to talk in a vague way and smushing these together.

are computed in the underlying presheaf category of towers in ùíú.
There they are computed degreewise in ùíú (see at limits in presheaf categories).
In the literature this appears for instance as (Schapira, def. 3.2.2).
As before the pushout is computed degreewise.
The construction above builds the mapping cone explicitly via the standard formula for homotopy pushouts.
Often however other presentations are more convenient:
This appears for instance as (Weibel, Exercise 1.2.8).
In additive categories with translation Let ùíú be an additive category with translation T=[1]:ùíú‚Üíùíú.
For an exposition of the following see there the section Relation to homotopy fiber sequences.
Write X[1] ‚Ä¢‚ààCh ‚Ä¢(ùíú) for the suspension of a chain complex of X.
This is a quasi-isomorphism.
So x n‚àí1 has to be found such that this pair is a cycle.
This shows that H n(h ‚Ä¢) is surjective.
Observe that H n(X[k] ‚Ä¢)‚âÉH n‚àík(X ‚Ä¢).
By the discussion there, this is indeed the action of the connecting homomorphism.
Notice that equivalently we can express the triangles via the mapping cylinder.

Let G be a Lie group.
Its schematic depiction is simply X={x‚ü∂idx}.
The triangle in the above cartoon symbolizes the evident way in which these morphisms compose.
hence also C(U) becomes a Lie groupoid.
We now discuss this smooth incarnation (EG) ‚Ä¢ of EG.
The projection p is the quotient projection of this action.
Pullbacks of pre-smooth groupoids are computed componentwise.
We now discuss the general axiomatization of this construction via categories of fibrant objects.
Those morphisms which are both weak equivalences and fibrations are called acyclic fibrations .
Let C be a category of fibrant objects.
The factorization lemma says the following.
Let Y I with factorization Y‚Üí‚âÉY I‚ü∂(d 0,d 1)Y√óY be a path space object for Y.
Both squares are pullback squares.
Since pullbacks of fibrations are fibrations, the morphism X^‚ÜíX√óY is a fibration.
Since these are stable under pullback, also X^‚ÜíX is an acyclic fibration.
But, by the axioms, Y I‚ÜíY has a right inverse Y‚ÜíY I.
This establishes the claim.
Let ùíû be a category of fibrant objects.
In view of this the following definition is natural.
And it is equivalent to ‚àûGrpd, the (‚àû,1)-category of bare ‚àû-groupoids.

The proof may be safely left to the reader.
There is no hope that normal spaces are closed under coequalizers or pushouts.
However, there are reasonable conditions under which pushouts will be normal.
This is the categorical backdrop for the following observation.
Let X be a compact Hausdorff space.
(In which case X/‚àº is compact Hausdorff.)
Consider its ‚àº-saturation A¬Ø, namely {x‚ààX:(‚àÉ a‚ààA)x‚àºa}=œÄ 1((‚àº)‚à©(X√óA)).
We reproduce the proof given here.
To prove that j is a subspace, let U‚äÜC be any open set.
It follows that j ‚àí1(W)=U, so that j is a subspace inclusion.
We remark that the ‚Äúif‚Äù part of the proof is very easy.
The following is a sample application.
We obtain a map Œ≤f:X‚Üí‚Ñù.
Finally, the restriction of œà to C is œï, as required.
A little use of notation allows a short exposition of this proof.
Then X=colim nX n is normal by applying Proposition .
Let X be a simply connected topological space.

This gives a representation of all (‚àû,1)-categories in terms of homotopical categories.
A specific notion of homotopical category is that of a model category.

In that case the above homotopy pullback has various realizations as an ordinary pullback.
Notably it may be expressed using path objects which may come from interval objects.
Thus the smooth loop space is not a loop space object.
Let C= Top with the standard interval object.
The generalization of this to smooth spaces is discussed at smooth loop space.

The ‚Äúlocal‚Äù topological properties of Euclidean space are inherited by locally Euclidean spaces:
Let X be a locally Euclidean space (def. ).
By definition, there is a Euclidean open neighbourhood ‚Ñù n‚Üí‚âÉœïU x‚äÇX around x.
By the first statement above the map is injective (via this lemma).
We will show something stronger: every irreducible closed subset is a singleton.
But by irreducibiliy, this union has to consist of just one point.
We need to find a connected open neighbourhood Cn x‚äÇU x.
By local Euclideanness, there is also a Euclidean neighboruhood ‚Ñù n‚Üí‚âÉœïV x‚äÇX.
This is a connected open neighbourhood of x as required.
We need to find a compact neighbourhood K x‚äÇU x.
By assumption there exists a Euclidean open neighbourhood ‚Ñù n‚Üí‚âÉœïV x‚äÇX.
Lemma (connected locally Euclidean spaces are path-connected)
A locally Euclidean space which is connected is also path-connected.
Observe now that both PConn x(X)‚äÇX as well as its complement are open subsets:
Now by assumption every point y‚ààX has a Euclidean neighbourhood ‚Ñù n‚Üí‚âÉU y‚äÇX.
Let X be a locally Euclidean space (def. ) which is Hausdorff.
1) ‚áí 2) Let X be sigma-compact.
This means that X is second-countable.
1) ‚áí 3) Let X be sigma-compact.
We show that then X is paracompact with a countable set of connected components:
This follows since locally compact and second-countable spaces are sigma-compact.
We show that X is sigma-compact.
By paracompactness there is a locally finite refinement of this cover.
Now fix any j 0‚ààJ.
From this the general statement follows since countable unions of countable sets are countable.
Hence assume that X is connected.
It follows from lemma that X is path-connected.
We prove this last claim by induction.
It is true for n=0 by construction.
In conclusion this implies that only a finite number of the V j intersect K n.
This is usually assumed to be the case.
Often a topological manifold (def. ) is required to be sigma-compact.
By this prop this implies that X is second-countable topological space.
For the differentiable structure we pick these Euclidean neighbourhoods from the given atlas.

Let G be a perfect discrete group.
Agros toposAAgeneralized spaces obey‚Ä¶AAexample:AAcohesionADef.
The former is manifestly the operation of evaluating on the terminal object.

Equivalently, Disc‚âÉp * is the constant diagram-assigning functor.
Let H be a cohesive topos (Def. ).
First observe, in the notation there, that ptp His epiAAAiffAAAptp Bis epi.
In one direction, assume that ptp B is an epimorphism.
In the other direction, assume that ptp H is an epimorphism.
This establishes the equivalence between the first two items.
This shows that concX‚âîim(Œ∑ X ‚ôØ) is indeed concret.
It remains to show that this construction is left adjoint to the inclusion.

Idea A (2,1)-sheaf is a sheaf with values in groupoids.
This is traditionally called a stack.
Let C be a (2,1)-site.
Write Grpd for the (2,1)-category of groupoids, functors and natural isomorphisms.
The (2,1)-category of a (2,1)-sheaves on a (2,1)-site forms a (2,1)-topos.
See model structure for (2,1)-sheaves.
Concretely, this is the category of presheaves on S.
Concretely, this is the category of copresheaves on S.

This is known as the free bicompletion of S.

Let X be a smooth manifold.
This is a derivation by the chain rule.
This algebra ‚Ñù[œµ]/(œµ 2) is known as the algebra of dual numbers over ‚Ñù.

But derivations of smooth functions are vector fields (prop. ).

Suppose that R is a pid.

Lifting limits is closely related to creating them.
Remark 13.38 provides a useful diagram of relations between reflected/created/lifted limits.
We say that P√ó GF‚ÜíX is the associated bundle to P‚ÜíX with fiber F.
We discuss here some basics and how this recovers the traditional definition.

A cyclic group is a quotient group of the free group on the singleton.
But see Ring structure below.
Of course, ‚Ñ§ itself is also ‚Ñ§/0.
Let A be a cyclic group, and let x be a generator of A.

Every finite abelian group is a direct sum of abelian groups over cyclic groups.

This entry is about the notion of ‚Äúlimit‚Äù in category theory.
The corresponding universal object for morphisms out of the diagram is the colimit.
This idea is explained more formally here.
This is what we do below.
See also the analogous discussion at homotopy limit.
Also seen are (respectively) inverse limits and direct limits.
The first system also appears in pro-object and ind-object.
Correspondingly, the symbols lim‚Üê and lim‚Üí are used instead of lim and colim.
In particular, the limit of a set-valued functor always exists.
In enriched category theory one has the notion of weighted limit.
In 2-category theory one has the notion of a 2-limit.
Similarly, in (infinity,1)-category theory there is a notion of a limit.
See limit in quasi-categories.
The central point about examples of limits is: Categorical limits are ubiquitous.
But any list is necessarily wildly incomplete.
For a pedagogical list of examples see limits and colimits by example.
A limit of the empty diagram is a terminal object.
A limit of a cospan is a pullback.
A limit over a finite category is a finite limit.
Another important ‚Äúshape‚Äù of limits are those that give rise to ends.
Frequently some limits can be computed in terms of other limits.
(More precisely, it suffices only to consider equalizers of reflexive pairs.)
In Set Limits in Set are hom-sets
In functor categories Proposition (limits in functor categories are computed pointwise)
Let D be a small category and let D‚Ä≤ be any category.
Let C be a category which admits limits of shape D.
Write [D‚Ä≤,C] for the functor category.
Let D be a small category such that C admits limits of shape D.
In general limits do not commute with colimits.
But under a number of special conditions of interest they do.
Special cases and concrete examples are discussed at commutativity of limits and colimits.
This paper refers to limits as inverse limits.
A more general notion is of a pseudoholomorphic map.
These are what originally were called algebraic stacks.
This case is the algebraic version of the general notion of geometric stack.
The Vopƒõnka principle Vopƒõnka‚Äôs principle has many equivalent statements.
This is (AdamekRosicky, theorem 6.28).
This is in (Rosicky)
But the VP is slightly stronger than this statement.
For every n, there exist arbitrarily large C(n)-extendible cardinals.
This is in (BCMR).
The Vopƒõnka principle implies the weak Vopƒõnka principle.
This is AdamekRosicky, theorem 6.22 and example 6.23
The following theorems are from (BCMR).
There exists a C(n)-extendible cardinal.
There exists a supercompact cardinal.
Many more refined results can be found in (BCMR).
Then the left Bousfield localization L ZW exists.
This is theorem 2.3 in (RosickyTholen) Corollary
The claim then follows with the (above theorem).
We might call this axiom schema the Vopƒõnka axiom scheme.
See, for instance, this MO question and answer.
Thus, being Vopƒõnka is much stronger than being almost-Vopƒõnka.

Let x be a limit point of ŒΩ.
By , it is sufficient to prove that x‚àâf ‚àí1(V).
We need to show that then x 1=x 2.

Conversely, assume that (X,œÑ) is not a Hausdorff space.
Take V 1‚âîU x 1 and take V 2=X.
(compact spaces are equivalently those for which every net has a converging subnet)
Let (X,œÑ) be a compact topological space.
Then every net in X has a convergent subnet.
Let ŒΩ:A‚ÜíX be a net.
We need to show that there is a subnet which converges.
To this end, we first need to build the domain directed set B.
It is clear B is a preordered set.
Hence with U bd‚âîU 1‚à©U 2 we have obtained the required pair.
Hence we have defined a subnet ŒΩ‚àòf.
Hence assume that (X,œÑ) is not compact.
We need to produce a net without a convergent subnet.
We will show that this net has no converging subnet.
This would imply that x J‚â†U x for all J‚äÉ{i x}.
This hence satisfies both ŒΩ f(e)‚ààU x as well as {i x}‚äÇf(b 1)‚äÇf(b).
Thus we have a proof by contradiction.
Indeed we can build a formal logic out of these.

(This is actually a consequence of REA.)
There are enough injective abelian groups.
The category of anafunctors between two small categories is essentially small.
However, it can fail in permutation models over proper classes.
Moreover, at least assuming classical logic, SVC + COSHEP implies AC.
The smash product on pointed topological spaces induces a smash product on spectra.
This is the canonical tensor product in the symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-category of spectra.
See at symmetric monoidal category of spectra for more on this.
See also at functor with smash products.
This has degree (‚àí1) n 1n 2 .
Thus there is no Day convolution product on sequential spectra at all.
We discuss local (‚Äúextended‚Äù) topological prequantum field theory.
Here the pattern of the discussion of examples is the following:
The ambient topos Prequantum field theory deals with ‚Äúspaces of physical fields‚Äù.
We here need this to mean the following Definition
Every cohesive (‚àû,1)-topos is in particular globally and locally ‚àû-connected, by definition.
This we discuss in Corner field theory.
We write Span n(H) for the resulting (‚àû,n)-category of spans.
All this we now describe more formally.
Therefore it makes sense to speak of bulk field theory in this case.
In (LurieTFT) this is denoted by ‚ÄúBord n fr‚Äù.
In itself this is a deep statement about the homotopy type of categories of cobordisms.
The central definition in the present context now is the following.
For H= ‚àûGrpd this is the perspective in (FHLT, section 3).
This is discussed in some detail at prequantized Lagrangian correspondence.
We now discuss this notion of groupoids more formally.
Here, for the time being, all groups are discrete groups.
(Here ‚Äú‚ô≠‚Äù denotes the ‚Äúflat modality‚Äù.)
Another canonical action is the action of G on itself by right multiplication.
This is known as the G-universal principal bundle.
See below in for more on this.
Below we generalize this to arbitrary homotopy types (def. ).
These correspondences of groupoids encode trajectories/histories of field configurations.
By prop. we have X√ó[Œ† 1(S 1),X]X‚âÉ[Œ† 1(S 1),X].
Along these lines one checks the required zig-zag identities.
This is described in def. below.
Therefore we cosider the following.
This is a monoidal (2,1)-functor.
One may regard this as a simple example of geometric representation theory.
More familiar are maybe cocycles in higher degree.
These are called the simplicial identities.
These in turn need to be connected by pentagonators and ever so on.
This provided by the orientals (due to Ross Street).
This is precisely what the horn-filler conditions in a Kan complex encode.
We review how 1-groupoids are incarnated as Kan complexes via their nerve.
For more along these lines see at geometry of physics ‚Äì homotopy types.
every morphism has an inverse under this composition.
This makes it manifest that these functions organise into a simplicial set.
The nerve operation constitutes a full and faithful functor N:Grpd‚ÜíKanCplx‚Ü™sSet.
It follows that the category KanCplx is naturally enriched over itself.
This comes with two inclusions i 0,i 1:*‚ÜíI of its endpoints.
The category ‚àûGrpd itself ‚Äúis‚Äù the canonical homotopy theory.
(For more on this see also at homotopy hypothesis.)
The following is the immediate generalization of def. .
Of relevance now are the following two standard facts.
Taken together, this provides us with the following very useful construction.
It provides us with a rich supply of Kan complexes, hence of ‚àû-groups.
Let G‚ààGrp(H) be a simply connected compact simple Lie group.
and write BG‚ààSmooth‚àûGrpd for its delooping stack.
This is essentially given by the first Pontryagin class p 1.
Hence in codimension-0 this is still just Loc G(Œ£).
However for metric spaces the two conditions happen to be equivalent
(X,d) is a sequentially compact topological space.
Assume first that (X,d) is a compact topological space.
Let (x k) k‚àà‚Ñï be a sequence in X.
We need to show that it has a sub-sequence which converges.
This proves that compact implies sequentially compact for metric spaces.
Let {U i‚ÜíX} i‚ààI be an open cover of X.
We need to show that there exists a finite sub-cover.
Therefore {U i s‚ÜíX} s‚ààS is a finite sub-cover as required.
Hence countably compact metric spaces are equivalently compact metric spaces.
(For now this is just the very rough idea.
More details to come.)
For more on this see monoidal Dold-Kan correspondence.
Frobenius monoidal functors are a special case of Frobenius linear functors between linearly distributive categories.
Baryons are the ‚Äúheavy‚Äù types of hadrons, the other being the mesons.
Examples of baryons are the nucleons: protons and neutrons.
Other examples are Lambda baryons.
Also pentaquarks are counted as baryons.

‚ÄòQuasiprojective‚Äô unifies affine, quasiaffine, projective and embedded quasiprojective k-varieties.
By the Hilbert Nullstellensatz there is a more invariant definition.
As topological spaces affine varieties are noetherian.
Embedded quasiaffine k-varieties are Zariski-open subspaces of affine k-varieties.
Morphisms between varieties are sometimes called regular maps?.
Sometimes a smooth algebraic variety may also be called algebraic manifold.
The remaining points are the generic points of subvarieties.
There are apparently hundreds of proofs.
(N.B.: this construction is specific to Euclidean geometry.)

Under passing to suspension spectra this becomes Atiyah duality in stable homotopy theory.
It is also the opposite poset of a frame.
A coframe homomorphism is a homomorphism of posets that preserves finite joins and arbitrary meets.
Coframes and coframe homomorphisms form the category Cofrm.

This is because the various V i constitute open neighbourhoods for all points x‚ààX.
locally finite refinement induces locally finite cover with original index set)
We need to show local finiteness.
Not to be confused with George Whitehead, who also worked in algebraic topology.
In that case the category is convenient, whereas here the objects are convenient.
See at Cahiers topos for more on this.
See at Exact couple of a tower of fibrations.
For D=4 these were first discussed by Dirac 63 and named singletons.
Adding the results, we have n(deg(x)+deg(y)+deg(z))‚â§3(deg(x)+deg(y)+deg(z))‚àí3 which is impossible if n‚â•3.
Taking n sufficiently large, we can easily derive the claimed inequality.
It is equivalent to the general form of Szpiro's conjecture.
See the references at inter-universal Teichm√ºller theory.
Comments on the proof are at Mochizuki's proof of abc.
A popular account of the problem of the math community checking the proof is in
Let E‚ÜífbŒ£ be a smooth vector bundle.
This makes Œì Œ£(E) a Fr√©chet topological vector space.
These integral kernels are the advanced/retarded ‚Äúpropagators‚Äù.
We discuss this by a variant of the Cauchy principal value:
The last step is simply the application of Euler's formula sin(Œ±)=12i(e iŒ±‚àíe ‚àíiŒ±).
This integration domain may then further be completed to two contour integrations.
The last line is Œî H(x,y), by definition .
On the left this identifies the causal propagator by (12), prop. .
This does not change the integral, and hence H is symmetric.
There is an evident variant of this combination, which will be of interest:
where in the second line we used Euler's formula.
In the first step we introduced the complex square root œâ ¬±œµ(k‚Üí).
We follow (Scharf 95 (2.3.18)).
Next we similarly parameterize the vector x‚àíy by its rapidity œÑ.
The important point here is that this is a smooth function.
We follow (Scharf 95 (2.3.36)).
This expression has singularities on the light cone due to the step functions.
This is the convolution of distributions of b^(k)e ik Œºa Œº with Œî^ S(k).
By prop. we have Œî^ S(k)‚àùŒ¥(‚àík Œºk Œº‚àí(mc‚Ñè) 2)sgn(k 0).
For more see the references at wave equation.
Formally one writes K(x,y)=‚à´exp(iS(œï))Dœï and calls this the path integral.
Assume we have the free Hamiltonian H=p 2/2m.
See (Strassler 92, (2.9), (2.10)).
For more discussion along these lines see at motivic quantization.
See at The BV-complex and homological integration for more details.
A closely related question is: What is the path integral ?
Beware also that the concept of well-pointed topos is unrelated.
He did his PhD in G√∂ttingen.
(See May-Ponto 12, p. 49 (77 of 542))

See also at material-structural adjunction.
This results in the well-founded pure sets.
In material set theory without urelements, every set is a pure set.
A set x is well-founded if it belongs to every ‚àà-inductive class C.
(That all sets are well-founded is the axiom of foundation.)
The discussion which follows is phrased informally, like most mathematics.
However, it is purely structural and can be interpreted in any structural set theory.
A convenient way to ‚Äúpicture‚Äù a pure set is with a graph.
A node i is called a child of a node j if i‚Üíj.
An accessible pointed graph is abbreviated APG.
Notice that ‚àÖ is an immediate subgraph, so we can write ‚àÖ‚àà‚ãÜ.
These sets are all well-founded.
In both cases, the unique immediate subgraphs verify that ‚Ä¢‚àà‚Ä¢.
Firstly, we have so far not eliminated the possibility of duplicate branches.
It is easy to eliminate APGs with such ‚Äúobviously redundant‚Äù branches.
Note also that if two rigid APGs are isomorphic, they must be uniquely isomorphic.
Thus, for rigid APGs, being isomorphic is a property, rather than structure.
Even among rigid APGs, however, there are are ambiguities.
Demand that duplicate occurrences always be identified, wherever they occur.
Define a notion of ‚Äúequivalence‚Äù between APGs which is looser than isomorphism.
We will consider them all in turn.
A tree may or may not be well-founded.
So we have ‚àÖ‚ààœâ N, ‚ãÜ‚ààœâ N, 2 N‚ààœâ, etc.
Given these definitions, one can prove the various axioms of material set theory.
The natural way to ensure this is to require our graphs to be extensional.
Thus, it requires at least limited separation.
Recall the notion of bisimulation.
This definition is also not predicative.
The relationship of this approach to the previous ones is as follows.
Every APG is equivalent to an extensional one.
This is the extensional quotient; see extensional relation.
Two extensional APGs are equivalent iff they are isomorphic.
The bisimulation relates each path x n‚Üí‚Ä¶‚Üí‚ä§ to its initial node x n.
Moreover, every APG is equivalent to a rigid accessible pointed tree.
Two well-founded rigid accessible pointed trees are equivalent iff they are isomorphic.
For assume that all the children of x and y have this property.
Therefore, ‚âÉ is a bijection between the children of x and the children of y.
Thus, by induction, ‚âÉ is a bijection.
(This makes sense since SAFA is incompatible with AFA.
Technically this works, but it is not very satifsying.
Every round chord diagram is also a Sullivan chord diagram.
For example, the following Jacobi diagram is NOT a Sullivan chord diagram:
A topological groupoid is an internal groupoid in the category Top.
Composition here refers to the map defined on the space of all composable morphisms.

The nLab is a collaborative wiki.
The most apt analogy for the nLab is of a group lab book.
To benefit from the work of others while we are doing it.
There are three things to say about this that are worth making very clear.
Our reasons for having the nLab are ultimately selfish.
The way that this is being worked out in practice is as follows.
Time will show if the nLab can live up to this goal.
Several contributors to the nLab are actively involved in research along these lines.
The nLab is meant as a place to collect, develop and present such research.
The nLab will be the better the more we discuss its contents.
For more on how to inject discussion into entries see the HowTo page.
Most importantly the nLab is not complete and not meant to be complete.
We all do this voluntarily.
Most of us have other duties to attend.
So don‚Äôt be annoyed with ‚Äúus‚Äù, help us.
Equivalently, it satisfies the descending chain condition for inclusions of closed sets.
The term quotient category has more than one meaning.
Sometimes it refers to the Serre quotient category by a thick subcategory.
This is an instance of a localization functor, often a strict localization functor.
Other times, it refers to an actual quotient of some kind in Cat.
This preservation of implication is called the K-axiom.
(This is an additional rule assumed in modal logics.)
This additional enhancement to T modal logic yields S4 modal logic.
See monad in computer science.
However, not every (co)monad is sensibly interpreted this way.
Under this interpretation nothing is necessarily true, and everything is possibly true.
See at modal operator for some examples.
Note, however, that these operations change the context from W to *.
(There are, however, more complicated possible worlds semantics.)
This is reflected in the subscripts of ‚óäW and ‚ñ°W above.
It is the choice of this W that gives different kinds of possibility and necessity.
This we come to below.
We now formalize and then analyze this example with the above prescription.
Now we may step back and see what the above formalization produce from this.
So consider the W-dependent identity type w:W‚ä¢(9=NumberOfPlanetsInTheSolarSystem)(w):Type.
Hence [‚óä W(9=NumberOfPlanetsInTheSolarSystem)] is true.
In English words, these formal consequences are to be pronounced as:
Which is just as it should be.
By these accounts, one who does probability theory is doing mathematics.
Perhaps probability theory may be viewed as a branch of epistemology.
Some reasons for holding that view follow.
All probabilities are conditional.
It is anything but clear which measure space it asks about.
But how fast will it approach that observed relative frequency?
Only when that has been specified is there a well-defined mathematical problem.
We might nonetheless reasonably approach it with the constraint of symmetry in the six indices.
It is not enough to answer the question: how fast?
von Mises missed the point.
One assigns a probability only to a measurable subset of a probability space.
That is called ‚Äúfrequentism‚Äù.
It is often asserted by both Bayesians and frequentists that that is subjective.
Thus Bayesians and frequentists put their subjectivity in different places.

Proof Let {U n} be a countable base of the topology.
there is a countable base of the topology.
metrisable: the topology is induced by a metric.
the topology of X is generated by a œÉ -locally discrete base.
Lindel√∂f: every open cover has a countable sub-cover.

first-countable: every point has a countable neighborhood base
a metric space has a œÉ -locally discrete base
: take the the collection of singeltons of all elements of a countable cover of X.
second-countable spaces are Lindel√∂f.
weakly Lindel√∂f spaces with countably locally finite base are second countable.
separable metacompact spaces are Lindel√∂f.
Lindel√∂f spaces are trivially also weakly Lindel√∂f.

Moreover this reinterpretation is missing the point of relative point of view.
In that case, you do not care what is underlying.
You are currently locking the entry, otherwise I would have done it.

But maybe we should highlight it at least more at beginning of entries.
Many Grothendieck-Rezk-Lurie (‚àû,1)-toposes are not equivalent to these.

In a similar vein, I suggested physical field at field.

I do not know why do you care that the entry LOOKS GOOD.
Look bibliography to formal scheme.
The long entries will be as short/long as they are now.
I will try not to loose anything and discuss the entries i would remove.
AST alteady exist as do pages for the other long entries.
Regarding Cayley i have seen the paper long before and have it on my computer.
Cayley calculates invariant theory in coordinates.
The paper do not define any categorical concept or prove a categorical theorem.
I would say it don‚Äôt start homological algebra.
How Cayley‚Äôs paper benefited category theory ?
You are concerned about syncing and difficulties.
There is a wikipedia and there is nlab.
I will also try to have good links.
So at the moment it would be nLab that benefits most.
I will look into your changes once again and try to keep them.
It is easier to only copy the links than to find them.
I have not included dualities.
I will check more now.
Now that nLab is fast enough it should go much better to edit the links.
Zoran ?koda?: created internal relation.
I see no reason for wikipedia to overwrite our work on changes.
I would not say that in that particular day only the links changed.
Urs, i have taken care of that.
I first updated the wikipedia timeline to match the nLab timeline.
I found nLabs way of comparing revisions often very hard to read.
I think it colors much more than need to be.

(The pospace I d is defined below amongst the examples.)

Remark An 1-plectic form is equivalently a symplectic form.

The dual concept is that of totalization of cosimplicial topological spaces.
This operation naturally extends to a functor |‚àí|:sTop‚ÜíTop.
An early reference that realizes this construction as a coend is (MacLane).
(This yields the underlying semi-simplicial set).
Simplicial topological spaces are in homotopy theory presentations for certain topological ‚àû-groupoids .
Recall the following definitions and facts from nice simplicial topological space.
We now discuss the resolution of any simplicial topological space by a good one.
The second sentence follows directly by the remarks above.
This also follows from results of (Gaunce Lewis 1982).
The proof can be found in Neil Strickland‚Äòs answer to this mathoverflow question.
Ordinary geometric realization has the following two disadvantages:
This appears as (Segal74, prop. A.1).
We discuss how geometric realization interacts with limits of simplicial topological spaces.
Proposition (geometric realization prerserves pullbacks)
This appears for instance as (May 1972, Cor. 11.6).
Write ‚Äñ*‚Äñ for the fat geometric realization of the point.
This is claimed in Gepner-Henriques 07, Remark 2.23.
In other words, the geometric realization is filtered by simplicial degree.
Since |X ‚Ä¢| 0=X 0, this is true for n=0.
For n=0 it is obvious.
Hence, by the above pushout square, so is L n m‚àí1X‚ÜíL n mX.
(Any Reedy cofibrant diagram is in particular objectwise cofibrant.)
This is claimed in Wang 18, Theorem 4.3, Remark 4.4.
This is more than we need and want to impose here.
For W¬ØG this is (RobertsStevenson, prop. 19).
Let for the following Top s‚Ü™Top be any small full subcategory.
Therefore Hom Top(U,œÉ) is a section of our function.
Therefore by prop. we have hocolimP ‚Ä¢‚âÉ|P ‚Ä¢| in Ho(Top).
By prop. we have that ‚ãØ=|X ‚Ä¢|√ó |W¬ØG||WG|.
In total we have shown hocolim(hofibœÑ)‚âÉhofib(hocolimœÑ).
An early reference for this classical fact is (Segal68).
There is a weak homotopy equivalence Œ©BG‚Üí‚âÉG. Proof
Write C(œÄ)‚ààsTop for the Cech nerve.
If X is a paracompact topological space then it is even a homotopy equivalence.
For paracompact X this goes back to (Segal68).
The general case is discussed in (DuggerIsaksen).
A generalization to parameterized spaces is in (RobertsStevenson, lemma 22).

For n=0 there is nothing of note.
Things are slightly more interesting for S[2](0,2).
This can be given using the language of polygraphs or computads.)
In this example there are no significant compositions.
To see examples of those, you need to look at n=3.
The new features occur in S[3](0,3).
We thus get S[3](0,3)‚âÖŒî[1] 2, a square.
A similar phenomenon occurs in higher dimensions.
There are two ‚Äòextra faces‚Äô in S[5](0,5), and so on.
The objects of S(NP) are the elements of P
The simplicially enriched categories constructed from spheres and inner horns also have simple descriptions.
The Duskin nerve of a bicategory is an extension of this construction.

And Kan-complex enriched categories are fibrant.

Formally, this can be enforced by an appropriate sheaf condition.
However, we can also address the case n=‚àû as follows.
To make the preceding sketch precise, one would need to formalize the sheaf condition.
We now mention one way of how this could be achieved.
MDiag n R consisting of spans We define a coverage for MDiag n R.
We may now formalize our earlier sketch definition as follows.
This could simplify the comparison to other presheaf models of higher categories.
The precise nature of these shape categories remains to be fully understood.
Examples Geometric computads are free instances of manifold-diagrammatic n-categories.
This can be related to the above discussion as follows.

Thus Kan complexes serve to support homotopy theory.

These are called the simplicial identities.
These in turn need to be connected by pentagonators and ever so on.
This provided by the orientals (due to Ross Street).
This is precisely what the horn-filler conditions in a Kan complex encode.
We review how 1-groupoids are incarnated as Kan complexes via their nerve.
The nerve operation constitutes a full and faithful functor N:Grpd‚ÜíKanCplx‚Ü™sSet.
This comes with two inclusions i 0,i 1:*‚ÜíI of its endpoints.
It follows that the category KanCplx is naturally enriched over itself.
This was shown by Carboni, Kelly, and Pedicchio.
That Œ†(X) is indeed a Kan complex is intuitively clear.

Forcing Forcing Idea
The language of forcing is generally used in material set theory.
There are several things we could do.
Obviously these are more or less equivalent ways of doing the same thing.
Arguably, most modern mathematicians would find the third the most natural.

There are several ways to describe what the fundamental properties of angles should be.
However, modulo that uncertainty, the above is a reasonable property to insist on.

A norm which satisfies the parallelogram identity is the norm associated with an inner product.
It is possible to show directly that this is an inner product.
Certain properties are easy to deduce directly from the formulae.
All but the last of these is a simple deduction from the formulae.
We multiply by 4 to simplify the notation.
The properties above were all reasonably straightforward deductions from the definition.
There is one more property that is needed which is a little more complicated.
First, we note a useful result about the continuity of the supposed inner product.
The map (u,v)‚Ü¶12(‚Äñu+v‚Äñ 2‚àí‚Äñu‚Äñ 2‚àí‚Äñv‚Äñ 2) is continuous.
We prove this by induction.
It is clearly true for the case n=1.
Next we observe that it holds for all n‚àà‚Ñ§.
Next, we prove it for pq‚àà‚Ñö.
In fact, it is sufficient to prove it for 1n with n‚àà‚Ñï.
For that we observe that ‚ü®u,1nv‚ü©=nn‚ü®u,1nv‚ü©=1n‚ü®u,nnv‚ü©=1n‚ü®u,v‚ü©.

For an ‚Äúapartness‚Äù, BV11 also require comparability (see below).
Any apartness space comes with an irreflexive relation ‚â∞ defined by x‚â∞y iff x‚ãà{y}.
This is a positive version of the negation of the specialization order.
In BV11, axiom 4 for the denial inequality is called the reverse Kolmogorov property.
This condition is also classically trivial: take B={y‚à£¬¨(y‚ãàA)}.
It implies comparability (for ‚â† the denial inequality).
This makes X an apartness space.
This makes X a topological space.
Since x‚ãà œÑA, there is an open set V with x‚ààV and V‚à©A=‚àÖ.
But then every y‚ààV satisfies y‚ãà œÑA, hence y‚ààU; so V‚äÜU.
In other words, the interiors of complements form a base for the topology.
In Bridges et. al. this condition is called being topologically consistent.
A sufficient condition for topological consistency is local decomposability.
This implies that x‚ààint(¬¨¬¨V)‚äÜ¬¨¬¨V‚äÜU, giving topological consistency.
(Of course, in classical mathematics every space is locally decomposable.)
Moreover, since f(x)‚ãàB we have x‚ãàC by apartness-continuity.
Thus, f ‚àí1(U) is open.

These were introduced in Kapranov & Voevodsky 2091.
There is then an obvious bicategory of such module categories.

They were also independently introduced and studied Forrester-Barker (2004).
All of the examples on this page are special cases of this one.

We call G an ‚àû-group.
Let G be a group object in the (‚àû,1)-topos H.
We may think of P//G as the action groupoid of the G-action on P.
For us it defines this G-action.
By Giraud's axioms characterizing (‚àû,1)-toposes, every groupoid object in H is effective.
We proceed by induction through the height of this diagram.
This shows that P//G is the Cech nerve of P‚ÜíX.
It remains to show that indeed X=lim ‚Üí nP√óG √ó n.
This proves the claim, by definition of effective epimorphism.
We discuss realizations of the general definition in various (‚àû,1)-toposes H.
Notice that, as every action group, this comes with a canonical map P//G‚ÜíBG.

However in topological vector spaces both concepts come together.
See also at topological concrete category.
Let X be a topological space and A‚äÇX a non-empty subset.
Consider the equivalence relation on X which identifies all points in A with each other.
The resulting quotient space (def. ) is often simply denoted X/A.
Consider the real numbers ‚Ñù equipped with their Euclidean metric topology.
Then the quotient space ‚Ñù/‚àº ‚Ñö is a codiscrete topological space.
So let U‚äÇ‚Ñù/‚àº be a non-empty subset.
Write œÄ:‚Ñù‚Üí‚Ñù/‚àº ‚Ñö for the quotient projection.
By definition U is open precisely if its pre-image œÄ ‚àí1(U)‚äÇ‚Ñù is open.

Let V be a topological vector space and B‚äÜV a subset.
We say that B is a Schauder basis if:
In the presence of the axiom of choice, Hamel bases always exist.
If B is a topological basis, then B has a dual basis.
By scaling, this functional can be assumed to satisfy f b(b)=1.
The trigonometric polynomials do form a topological basis.
The dual basis is given by taking the Fourier coefficients of a function.
The following is a Schauder basis.
Let (d n) be the sequence {0,1,12,14,34,‚Ä¶}.
Then f n forms a Schauder basis for C([0,1],‚ÑÇ).

Contents Idea By quantization is meant some process
(Hence more precisely: is there a natural Synthetic Quantum Field Theory?)
The following spells out an argument to this effect.
This Lie bracket is what controls dynamics in classical mechanics.
Something to take notice of here is the infinitesimal nature of the Poisson bracket.
There may be different global Lie group objects with the same Lie algebra.
From here the story continues.
It is called the story of geometric quantization.
We close this motivation section here by some brief outlook.
These are the actual wavefunctions of quantum mechanics, hence the quantum states.
For more on this see at Wick algebra and causal perturbation theory.
This is now known as ‚Äúclassical physics‚Äù.
The true dynamics in turn is ‚Äúquantum physics‚Äù.
As such it is not well defined, i.e. unique, when it exists.
Additional structures sometimes make it unique.
These traditional formulations are geared towards mechanics (as opposed to field theory).
The goal is to get closer to a systematic theory of quantization.
In the context of field theory the conceptual issues become even more severe.
More on this is in (Nuiten 13) and at motivic quantization.
(See (Nuiten13) for more.)
See at BV-BRST formalism ‚Äì Homological integration.

Let G fin be a finite group.
This category is equivalent to R[G]-mod.
Let G be a compactum.
Let G-Ban be the category of Banach representations of G.
Maps in G-Ban are short maps which are G-equivariant.
In both cases, we get a ‚Äúbar construction‚Äù.
Hence there are evident face maps without degeneracies.
Now the bar resolution ‚ãØ‚ü∂‚ü∂‚ü∂C(G√óG)‚àè‚Ñù[G]‚ü∂f‚Ü¶(g‚Ü¶‚à´ h‚ààGf(g,h))‚ü∂*C(G)‚àè‚Ñù[G]‚ü∂‚à´ G‚Ñù has degeneracies as well.
This result was first proven by Weil.
A proof can be found in these online notes by Rubinstein-Salzedo.
C c(G)=C(G) is such a Banach representation.
This could be seen as an equivariant Hahn-Banach theorem.
Take an injection of Banach representations of G, X‚ÜíY.
Let f:X‚Üí‚Ñù be a map of Banach representations of G.
Let S be the collection of G-invariant compact convex subsets of this set.
Abelian groups are obviously unimodular; so are compact groups and discrete groups.

Besides the monumental Mazzola (2002), the following employ category theory:
Other ‚Äúmathemusical‚Äù topics include:
In type theory, a negative type is one whose eliminators are regarded as primary.
The opposite notion is a positive type, forming two polarities.
The two definitions are equivalent in ordinary type theory, but distinct in linear logic.
The same is true of binary sum types if we allow sequents with multiple conclusions.
A hypergraph category is a monoidal category whose string diagrams are hypergraphs.
The name ‚Äúhypergraph category‚Äù is more recent (Kissinger and Fong).
The same is probably true of relations in any regular category.
The category FinRel is not hypergraph when given the + monoidal structure.
Categories of decorated cospans and decorated corelations are hypergraph categories.
This is what enables the hypergraph string diagrams described informally above.
More general free hypergraph categories can be constructed using labeled cospans.
The morphisms are compatible cospans of functions (up to isomorphism).
A lax monoidal functor is the same thing as a monoid for the Day convolution.
Thus hypergraph categories are monoids in the presheaf category [Cospan Œî,Set].
This is called tachyon condensation.
String field theory aimed to provide that notion of action functional.
However, the algebraic expressions involved tend to be hard to handle in their complexity.
Little is known about the true quantum effects of the string field theory action functional.
So far string field theory is defined in terms of an action functional.
So, strictly speaking, it is defined as a classical field theory.

The notion of geometric theory has many different incarnations.
A geometric theory is a syntactic description of a Grothendieck topos.
Theories involving only these are examples of cartesian theories.
Theories involving only ‚àß, ‚ä§, and ‚àÉ are regular theories.
Theories which add these to regular logic are called coherent theories.
The interpretation of arbitrary uses of ‚áí and ‚àÄ requires a Heyting category.
The former admits a more concise axiomatisation as {‚ä§‚ä¢‚ä•}.
Propositional theories are classified by localic toposes (see there for further information).
Similarly, the theory of fields of finite characteristic is geometric but not coherent.
The theory of the standard successor algebra is geometric.
The classifying topos is Set.
The theory of a real number is geometric.
The classifying topos of this theory is the topos of sheaves on the real numbers.
The theory of flat diagrams1 over a small category ùíû is geometric.
This theory is classified by the topos of presheaves over ùíû.
(Elephant calls these torsors over ùíû, generalizing the established terminology for groups.)
In fact, the models of the theory are the filtered colimits of representables.
This topos Set[T] is called the classifying topos of T.
We say that two geometric theories with equivalent classifying topoi are Morita equivalent.
The following approach is described in B4.2 of the Elephant.
One theory that should certainly be geometric is the theory of objects, O.
How can we construct more theories that ought to be geometric?
For any theory T, let‚Äôs call a transformation T‚ÜíO a geometric construct.
The following definition is sort of a ‚Äúhalfway house‚Äù between logic and geometry.
Start with a first-order signature Œ£ (this is the logical part).
Equivalently, of course, this is a T-model in S[T‚Ä≤].
The composition of maps should be evident.
Stone duality for geometric theories is discussed in:
This is also sometimes called the theory of flat functors on ùíû. ‚Ü©
Equivalently, it is the cohomological dual concept to stable homotopy homology theory.
By the Pontryagin-Thom theorem this is equivalently framed cobordism cohomology theory.
See a separate page for semantics of a programming language.
Notably the semantics of type theories is given by categories.
Then this is again complete: every Cauchy sequence of functions converges uniformly.

When both are odd graded then this is the anti-commutator.
This page is concerned with the general superposition of solutions of linear differential equations.
For the special case of quantum superposition see there.
A monad is called p.r.a.
if its functor part is p.r.a. and moreover its unit and multiplication are cartesian.
Thus in particular it is a cartesian monad.
A p.r.a. monad is also called a strongly cartesian monad.
It follows that any p.r.a. monad is a cartesian monad.
Note that by the definition of genericity, generic factorizations are unique whenever they exist.
This is Proposition 2.6 of (Weber08).
P.r.a. functors between presheaf categories have an especially nice form.
More details are in Remark 2.12 of (Weber08).
Thus T is a parametric right adjoint.
In the ordinary analysis of real numbers, the only infinitesimal number is zero.
There are several different ways to develop a rigorous theory that includes infinitesimal numbers.
According to this definition, 0 is always infinitesimal.
(Although the argument is even stronger here, since it‚Äôs always decidable?
So the interesting question is how to get other infinitesimals.
This results in a local integral domain if R is a field.
Instead of working with free infinitesimals, we could also work with nilpotent infintiesimals.
This requires working in an Archimedean ordered Artinian local ‚Ñù -algebras.
Since A is an ordered ‚Ñù-algebra, there is a strictly monotone ring homomorphism h:‚Ñù‚ÜíA.
Zero is the only number in A which is both purely real and purely infinitesimal.
One could also work with partial functions instead of functions.
That is the approach taken by Abraham Robinson in nonstandard analysis.
Since infinitesimals were used to do calculus, then let's just do calculus.
This is the approach taken by Bill Lawvere and others in synthetic differential geometry.
I don't know much about this.
(This is also true for all the surreal infinitesimals.)
However, it is not clear whether any more precise comparison can be made.

Nontrivial: Every point x has a neighbourhood.
This filter is called the neighbourhood filter of x.
A pretopology can also be given by a base or subbase.
A pretopological space is a set equipped with a pretopological structure.
In this way, pretopological spaces and continuous maps form a category PreTop.
This relation satisfies the following properties:
In this way, every pretopological space becomes a convergence space.
Actually, we can do more.
Thus, PreTop is also a reflective subcategory of Conv.
Then U‚àò is a neighbourhood of each of its members.

This example can probably be generalised to a uniform space S.
is open if it equals its preinterior.
A set A is closed if it equals its preclosure.
(This result seems to require excluded middle.)
This terminology is based on the premise that a closure should be closed.)
In many cases this iteration stabilizes after finitely many terms.
The plus power S n seems to stabilise after n iterations.
And in a topological space, of course, it only takes one step.
In general, however, there can be transfinitely many terms in these sequences.
Note that an interior is open, and a closure is closed.
Therefore, ‚Äúcomplete small category‚Äù is a safer term for our concept.)
In particular, any complete small category is a preorder.
A brief description of the argument can be found in the answer to this question.
See Hyland88 and HRR90 for details.
Complete small categories have applications to the modeling of impredicative polymorphism.
Suppose that there is a full subcategory C of Set that is small and complete.
At least at first glance, this requires C to be strongly complete.
Hence it works in the category of assemblies, but not the entire realizability topos.

Generally speaking, predicative mathematics treats infinite suplattices only as large objects.
In particular, SupLat (and hence InfLat) is still a monadic category.
An E ‚àû-space is an commutative ‚àû-monoid in Top.
Grouplike E ‚àû-spaces are equivalently infinite loop spaces.

A re-proof of the classification is claimed in (Allock 15).

The comparison morphism (Def. ) is injective on connected components.
But the remaining data is then all in Œ≥(‚àí).
The comparison morphism (Def. ) is surjective on connected components.

Lemma The comparison morphism (Def. ) is injective on fundamental groups.
The remaining data is Œ≥(‚àí):[0,1]√óS n+2‚ÜíŒì.
Therefore it is sufficient to consider the connected component of the trivial cocycle c.

Connective spectra form a sub-(‚àû,1)-category of spectra Top‚Üê‚äÉConnectSp(Top)‚Ü™Sp(Top).
These are the non-connective spectra.
For general spectra there is a notion of homotopy groups of negative degree.
The connective ones are precisely those for which all negative degree homotopy groups vanish.

Exactly which pairs of sets of rational numbers can appear this way?
Similarly, U is inhabited.
Using open intervals This definition is due to Vickers15.
This is entirely constructive.
By (5), we have a<b<y for some b.
Applying (7), we have a<x or x<b.
Since x<b<y contradicts our assumptions, we have a<x.
Therefore, x and y are equal (as pairs of subsets).
In particular, connectedness of < corresponds to antisymmetry of ‚â§.
Thus every rational number is interpreted as a real number.
‚ÄúOnly if‚Äù is by condition (5).
Remark Equality of Dedekind cuts is stable (under double negation).
The conditions (5&6) are not really necessary.
In a similar vein, we can weaken (3,4,7) as follows:
(Actually, the somewhat weaker limited principle of omniscience seems to suffice.)
Any such set L of rational numbers is a lower cut.
Similarly, a set U that satisfies (2,4,6) is an upper cut.
Unlike the covering cuts in the previous section, these are actually of interest constructively.
In predicative mathematics, subsets are large and therefore are proper classes.
The definitions then become There is a rational number a such that L(a)=‚ä§.
There is a rational number b such that U(b)=‚ä§.
If L(a)=‚ä§, then there is a rational number a<b such that L(b)=‚ä§.
If U(b)=‚ä§, then there is a rational number a<b for some U(a)=‚ä§.
For example, we could start with the real algebraic numbers or the computable numbers.

Crucially, the definition of A may use B.
Without this last requirement, we could first define A and then separately B.

For example equipping them with orthogonal structure encodes Riemannian geometry on manifolds.
This way differential and smooth manifolds are the basis for differential geometry.
They are the analogs in differential geometry of what schemes are in algebraic geometry.
In fact both of these concepts are unified within synthetic differential geometry.
For convenience, we first recall here some background on topological manifolds:
This is usually assumed to be the case.
Often a topological manifold (def. ) is required to be sigma-compact.
Moreover, manifolds with uncountably many connected components are rarely considered in practice.
For convenience we recall the definition of differentiable functions between Euclidean spaces.
Let n‚àà‚Ñï and let U‚äÇ‚Ñù n be an open subset.
The map df x is called the derivative or differential of f at x.
We say that f is twice continuously differentiable if df is continuously differentiable.
The analog of the concept of homeomorphism (def. ) is now this:
Here we illustrate the differentiable case.
The following property, which holds at the continuous level, is essential.
Let F:X‚ÜíY be a continuous surjection.
Then Q is a sheaf on Y.
We can phrase the example of RP n in this language.
So far this only confirms that RP n is a real topological manifold.
Hence (RP n,ùí™ RP n) is a smooth manifold.
This defines a smooth structure (def. ) on ‚Ñù n and D n.
Finally the n-sphere is a paracompact Hausdorff topological space.
Compact spaces are evidently also paracompact.
By this prop this implies that X is second-countable topological space.
For the differentiable structure we pick these Euclidean neighbourhoods from the given atlas.

Stone duality is often described for topological spaces rather than for locales.
Any distributive lattice generates a free frame.
Note that one must additionally restrict to ‚Äúcoherent maps‚Äù between coherent locales.
Therefore, the category of Stone spaces is dual to the category of Boolean algebras.
The Boolean algebra corresponding to a Stone space consists of its clopen sets.
This duality may be realized via a dualizing object as follows.
A Stone space is by definition a totally disconnected compact Hausdorff topological space.
Let Stone‚Ü™CH denote the full subcategory of Stone spaces.

This approach has been realized in the programming language Eff.
Continuations are not algebraic effects.
This is the case for many monoidal categories in which one considers dualizability.
(In Rel, all objects are dualizable.)
Unfortunately, conventions on left and right vary and sometimes contradict their use for adjoints.
If moreover it is symmetric, it is called a compact closed category.
See category with duals for more discussion.
We can define Œµ:V *‚äóV‚Üík to be the obvious pairing.
See at dualizable module for more.
This is a version of Spanier-Whitehead duality.
See at KK-theory ‚Äì Poincare duality.
See at (‚àû,1)-category of (‚àû,1)-modules ‚Äì Compact generation for more.
Dualizable objects support a good abstract notion of trace.
Dualizable objects in an symmetric monoidal (‚àû,1)-category are already fully dualizable objects.
See at cobordism hypothesis ‚Äì Framed version ‚Äì Implications: Canonical O(n)-action.
This appears as (Lurie, def. 2.3.5).
Then C has duals for objects precisely if BC has all adjoints.
Then the short maps are precisely the enriched functors between metric spaces.
And short maps do that.
Short maps give the category of metric spaces some nice properties.
In Met ord every object X admits an injective hull Œµ(X).
The space Œµ(X) is compact if X is compact.
Consider the category of sets and the (covariant) power set functor ùí´.
As they remark, every presheaf category carries a canonical class of open maps.
If y‚ààF n+1 maps to x‚ààF n, we call y a predecessor of x.
Let P be the covariant power-object functor on the presheaf topos.
Each forest F carries a canonical coalgebra structure over the endofunctor Ps *.
Remark: Joyal and Moerdijk actually refine this idea as follows.
The reader can probably think of other variations on this theme.
Equivalently this is the Grassmannian Gr 1(‚Ñù n+1).
It has the homotopy type of the Eilenberg-MacLane space K(‚Ñ§/2,1)=B‚Ñ§/2.
(Note that this is not related to monads on multicategories.)
Unlike monadic categories they need not have products.
The forgetful functor from a multimonadic category creates connected limits.
In set theory Let S be a set equipped with a binary relation ‚â∫.
Edward Witten is a theoretical physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study.
No-one invented it on purpose, it was invented by a lucky accident.
By rights, twentieth century physicists shoulnd‚Äôt have had the priviledge of studying this theory.
I think it was a very wise remark.
But at a very fundamental level it‚Äôs not well understood.
Many famous non-computable numbers may be expressed as limits of Specker sequences.
(This amounts to treating it as a computable lower real number.)
The square on the right is that from Prop. .

An elliptic surface is an elliptic fibration over an algebraic curve.
Every polynomial monad is a p.r.a. monad.
Since all polynomial functors preserve pullbacks, a polynomial monad is necessarily a cartesian monad.
Thus, all the data of a polynomial monad can be described very concretely.
Polynomial monads have close relations with a number of other notions.
Polynomial monads have a natural interpretation in terms of object classifiers.
This comes with source and target functors Cart(C)/g‚áâC.
This claim could stand some independent verification.
For example, consider the free monoid monad above determined by g:‚Ñï‚Ä≤‚Üí‚Ñï.
Other interesting examples include:
A fairly comprehensive discussion of the notion is due to

It suffices to consider a‚Ä≤=0,b‚Ä≤=1,c‚Ä≤=‚àû where one applies the transformation x‚Ü¶(x‚àía)(b‚àíc)(x‚àíc)(b‚àía).
Hence M√∂bius = conformal transformations take circles to circles.
Thus we may restrict attention to lattices of the form L=‚ü®1,œÑ‚ü©.

Let T be the Lawvere theory of commutative associative algebras over k.
Write sCAlg k ‚àò for the (‚àû,1)-category presentable (‚àû,1)-category.
Then we have an equivalence of (‚àû,1)-categories ‚àûCAlg k‚âÉ(sCAlg k) ‚àò.
This is a special case of the general statement discussed at (‚àû,1)-algebraic theory.

This construction generalizes to pyknotic objects for any (‚àû,1)-category.
The global sections functor is given by evaluation at the one-point compactum.
The topos of pyknotic sets is thus not cohesive (BarHai 19, 2.2.14).
Pyknotic sets can be described as sheaves on several different sites.
So they can be understood as models for a large Lawvere theory.
A pyknotic set carries finite coproducts to products in Set.
This is an indication that AbTop does not have enough objects.
This occurs because the category of topological spaces does not have an internal hom.

Let g a(x,y)=x+y be the formal additive group.
The regularity condtions imply that the zero map R/(p)‚ÜíR/(p) must be injective.
This implies that R contains the rational numbers as a subring.
The regularity conditions are trivial.
This is a free functor: Rng ‚Üí Ring.
For A‚ààRAlg nu we say A + is the unitalization of A.
The unitalization functor is not a conservative functor (Andruszkiewicz).
Sublocales Sublocales Idea A sublocale is a subspace of a locale.
There are multiple equivalent ways to formally define this concept.
This map is the nucleus j.
Then j is the nucleus corresponding to the sublocale L‚ÜíL/E.
Given a nucleus j:L‚ÜíL, the subset j(L) is a sublocale.
Of course, every locale L is a sublocale of itself.
Conversely, every locale has an empty sublocale, given by j ‚àÖ(U)‚âîL.
Suppose that U is an open in the locale L.
The cyclic vector is hence the tautological œà œÅ‚âî[1].
Let ùíû be a C *-category.

The identity morphism of our complex to itself induces an isomorphism on its cohomology.
This is only possible when all cohomologies vanish and our complex is exact.
The continuity of the differential operators P and P * is standard.
The only nontrivial check is on the Green functions.
The first of these is the statement 1) to be proven.
In particular, the two arguments may come from very different spaces.
When that is possible, we get an honest symplectic or Poisson bracket.
The corresponding P-Peierls bracket (def. ) is the original Peierls bracket.
It is a slight variant on the model structure on simplicial presheaves.

warning careful, this needs a bit more attention.
The general idea is obvious, but the details require care.
An important special case is that of a derived elliptic curve.
The idea of a closed midpoint algebra comes from Peter Freyd.
Every closed midpoint algebra homomorphism is a monotone.
That is: The empty set ‚àÖ is in ‚Ñ≥.
If S and T are in ‚Ñ≥, then so is their union S‚à™T.
The empty set ‚àÖ is in ‚Ñ≥.
If S and T are in ‚Ñ≥, then so is their union S‚à™T.
If S and T are in ‚Ñ≥, then so is their relative complement T‚àñS.
Of course, every Œ¥-ring is a ring, but not conversely.
That is: The empty set ‚àÖ is in ‚Ñ≥.
If S and T are in ‚Ñ≥, then so is their union S‚à™T.
If S and T are in ‚Ñ≥, then so is their relative complement T‚àñS.
Now (2) is simply redundant; S‚à™T=S‚à™T‚à™T‚à™T‚à™‚ãØ.
That is: The empty set ‚àÖ is in ‚Ñ≥.
If S and T are in ‚Ñ≥, then so is their union S‚à™T.

However, things do not work out as nicely.
We do get something by general abstract nonsense, of course.
What is missing is a simple description of the œÉ-algebra generated by ‚Ñ¨.
For a ring, the only difference is to use intersections only of inhabited families.
Continue by recursively, defining Œ£ n for all natural numbers n.
Continue by transfinite recursion, defining Œ£ Œ± for all countable ordinal numbers Œ±.
So we need an ‚Ñµ 1 steps, not just 2.
In the classical, associative case of course the operad and its Koszul dual coincide.
Cyclic operads also appear in TQFT-related constructions, often with more structure.
This simple definition hides a lot of structure.
Suppose i is a sieve.
This is also the same as the cocomma object? (B‚Üëi).
Write B‚ÜíuMi‚ÜípB for the evident inclusion and projection.
Consider the adjunction D(Mi)‚áÑp *p !D(B).
Explicitly, the left adjoint is p !u *.
It also has a right adjoint defined dually.
This is the purpose of the following definition and lemma.
Thus, the first square is always homotopy exact.
Theorem is not best possible, however.
If we know some things about them, then we can correspondingly weaken this condition.
Write LÀá 0=L 0‚àñL^ 0, and suppose the following.
Let M^ L be the codirected mapping cylinder of LÀá 0‚Ü™L.
Therefore, the theorem follows as before.
The other case is dual.
(The other functor a * essentially implements the equivalence D1‚âÉD(Œì,bc).)
The description in terms of relative diagram categories makes it clear that Œ£‚ä£Œ©.
Therefore we have Œ£‚âÖr !ab *s *.
(Note that zero objects are absolute colimits in Set *-categories.)
Moreover, the functor C¬Ø‚ÜíD¬Ø is always locally null-final.
It remains to consider the axiom (Der1) regarding coproducts.
Does (Der4) on Beck-Chevalley conditions carry back over?
Does this require a ‚Äúpointed version of Cisinski‚Äôs theorem‚Äù?
(This approach was used by Franke (see below).)
It requires a little work to show that this is a derivator.

This entry is about the notion of frame in topos theory.
For other notions, see frame (disambiguation).
(Note that the converse holds in any case, so we have equality.)
Frames and frame homomorphisms form the category Frm.
But notice that the frame homomorphisms are not required to preserve the Heyting implication.
For more on this see locale.
Conversely, any topological space has a frame of open subsets.
A complete decidable linear order is a frame.
More generally, but for this notational clash, Y//X could denote the nerve.
Let D(N(X‚áâY)) denote this category.
We denote this graded category D mix(N(X‚áâY))
The content of the Grothendieck trace formula connects these two constructions.
This categorification was described independently by Rouquier and Khovanov‚ÄìLauda combinatorially.
This results in a stronger criterion, definable in a less general context.
A definition may also be given in terms of uniform covers.
Two (quasi)uniform spaces are uniformly homeomorphic if there exists a uniform homeomorphism between them.
We may also speak of antiuniform homeomorphisms between antiuniformly homeomorphic quasiuniform spaces.
Also, every uniformly continuous or antiuniformly continuous map between quasiuniform spaces is Cauchy continuous.
The composite of two antiuniformly continuous maps is uniformly continuous.
Examples continuous metric space valued function on compact metric space is uniformly continuous

Hence this is an injection of E into a trivial vector bundle.
With this the statement follows by prop. .
This gives product map E 1√óE 2‚ÜíM√óM which is still a vector bundle.

They can be used to characterize the syntax of both natural language and programming languages.
Fix a finite set V called the vocabulary, also called the terminal symbols.
Let V + denote the free semigroup, i.e. non-empty strings.
X+Y and X√óY denote the disjoint union and the Cartesian product respectively.
This sequence is called a grammatical derivation.
In categorial grammars, monoidal categories are replaced by biclosed monoidal category.
The notions of coboundary and concordance exist in every cohesive (‚àû,1)-topos.
Differential linear logic is an extension of linear logic.
New inference rules are added which allow to differentiate proofs.
We start by presenting the version without additives and with promotion.
We will refer to this logic as DiLL.
There are two ways to present the syntax in sequent calculus.
There are no novelties concerning formulas compared to linear logic.
We will work with the formulas of Multiplicative Exponential Linear Logic (MELL).
Formulas are given by induction starting from atoms and applying connectives.
If we have two formulas A,B, we can form A‚äóB.
If we have two formulas A,B, we can form A‚ÖãB.
If we have a formula A, we can form !A.
If we have a formula A, we can form ?A.
If we have a formula A, we can form A ‚ä•.
We have the formula 1.
We have the formula ‚ä•.
If we have a formula A, we put (!A) ‚ä•=?A ‚ä•.
If we have a formula A, we put (?A) ‚ä•=!A ‚ä•.
We have ‚ä• ‚ä•=1.
We have preferred writting directly all the equalities of pratical use.
Inference rules will allow us to build proofs.
Notice that compared to MELL, we need the ability to sum proofs.
We give an explicit rule for this summation of proofs.
We give also a rule for null proofs.
The tricky part is to interpret the exponentials !,?.
We just need to add enough to interpret !
, the interpretation of ? will follow by the *-autonomous structure.
The coderiliction is added on top of this structure.
Book HoTT is the dependent type theory which appears in the HoTT book.
Types are represented by terms of a Russell universe.
There are many different ways to define the layer containing the natural numbers primitive:
We begin with the formal rules of the first layer.
Let ùí• be any arbitrary judgment.
We also assume cumulativity for the Russell universes.
There is another version of equality in book HoTT, called typal equality.
Typal equality is represented by the identity type.

We don‚Äôt know what it is.
We have a patchwork picture.
The refinement to higher geometry is E-infinity geometry (spectral geometry).
Cylinder spectra serve to define left homotopy of spectra as for other cylinder objects.
Chain complexes with chain maps between them form the category of chain complexes.
If these are all isomorphisms, then f is called a quasi-isomorphism.

These early simulations were not found conclusive in Lelli et al 16, section 8.2.
A conceptual explanation via stellar feedback is discussed in GBFH 19.
See also infinitesimally thickened point.
When it is satisfied, (ùíØ,R) is called a smooth topos.
The study of these is known as synthetic differential geometry.
Another notion of infinitesimals has arisen in the context of nonstandard analysis.
Here is how to think of what this definition means intuitively.
Now let Œ£ be any other space.
But suppose that Œ£ were infinitesimal.
These violate the finite-dimensionality assumption on J.
There are several different objects that one may think of as an infinitesimal interval.
This is described in more detail at infinitesimal interval object.
See page 20 of MSIA.
So modulo x 2, every smooth function is in fact a polynomial function.
See pages 19-20 of MSIA.
All of the infinitesimal spaces above are contained in the corresponding infinitesimal neighbourhood.
So this is the ‚Äúlargest‚Äù of the infinitesimal spaces discussed here.
Much of this is being reworked at infinity-Lie algebroid.
Notice that this implies also that ‚àÄi,i‚Ä≤,j:œµ i jœµ i‚Ä≤ j=0.
But this is indeed the case.
Dually this is a smooth cosimplicial algebra.
This subspace is precisely that of differential k-forms.
This we now describe in detail.
We have already seen that degreewise the vector spaces in question are isomorphic.
It remains to check that the differentials agree.
So this is indeed the action of the de Rham differential.
Discussion of infinitesimals goes back to Leibniz.
It was from this insight that synthetic differential geometry was eventually developed.
This is a classical case of general abstract nonsense used to understand a subtle situation.
For K=HR an Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum this reduces to ordinary homology.
See at generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology for more.
Write Top CW */ for the corresponding category of pointed topological spaces.
Write Ab ‚Ñ§ for the category of integer-graded abelian groups.
We identify Top CW‚Ü™Top CW ‚Ü™ by X‚Ü¶(X,‚àÖ).
We say E ‚Ä¢ is additive if it takes coproducts to direct sums:
In one direction, suppose that E ‚Ä¢ satisfies the original excision axiom.
Hence the excision axiom implies E ‚Ä¢(X,B)‚ü∂‚âÉE ‚Ä¢(A,A‚à©B).
Conversely, suppose E ‚Ä¢ satisfies the alternative condition.
This shows the statement for the special case that X=Int(A)‚à™Int(U).
(For more see the references at generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology.)
This turned out to be subtle.
Polynomials serve as a notion of ‚Äúhigher signature‚Äù.
We will follow a suggestion by Mike to have a SortOf function instead.
This should make some definitions less cluttered.
Let I:ùí∞ be a type of sorts.
TODO: Continue writing this out.
Here we collect the definitions and ideas that were given in Eric‚Äôs talk.
We can also use the Agda formalisation for reference too.
Fix a type I of sorts.
The Opi and Param i(f,j) are not truncated at set level.
So operations and parameters can have higher homotopy.
We start with the simplest non-trivial example, when I‚â°1 the unit type.
Looking at Poly1 we clearly have Op:1‚Üíùí∞‚âÉùí∞. So Op is simply a type.
Now if Op‚â°Fin 3 then there would be 3 operations.
Even letting Paramo 1 be some arbitrary type gives us an interesting object.
A polynomial P:PolyI generates an associated type of trees.
See also the remark in (Schroer, footnote 14, page 34).
We state the theorem for a vacuum representation on Minkowski spacetime.
The generalization to other dimensions can be done by the reader.
That means the previous equality holds for arbitrary translations U(x),x‚àà‚Ñù 4.
Recall that weak additivity holds in the vacuum representation.
More generally there cannot be a nonzero localized observable that annihilates the vacuum.
This fact is sometimes referred to as the existence of vacuum fluctuations.
The propositions in a logic naturally form a Heyting prealgebra under entailment.

In its refined form this goes by the name TCFT.
Often pid is used as an abbreviation of ‚Äúprincipal ideal domain‚Äù.
See at function field analogy ‚Äì table for more on this.
Then the ideal generated by a,x is principal, say (b).
Thus (x) has no proper extension: (x) is maximal.
In an integral domain we conclude 1=vb; thus b is a unit.
(For the converse statement, see here.)
Define a homomorphism p j:M‚à©F ‚â§j‚ÜíR by p j((x,r))=r.
We claim that {m k:k‚ààK} forms a basis for M.
First we prove linear independence of {m k}.
The assertion now follows by induction.
Now, we have p j(m)=r‚ãÖr j for some r; put m‚Ä≤=m‚àírm j.
Thus the m k generate M, as claimed.
A subgroup of a free abelian group is also free abelian.
In particular, submodules of projective modules are projective.
By Theorem , it follows that M is free.
Let R be a pid.
Then an R-module M is torsionfree if and only if it is flat.
In the other direction, suppose M is torsionfree.
For the converse, let œÜ be an arbitrary proposition.
Consider the ideal {x‚àà‚Ñ§|(x=0)‚à®œÜ}.
In the first case ¬¨œÜ holds, in the second œÜ.
However, this ideal cannot be proved to be finitely generated either.
Therefore, ‚Ñ§ remains a B√©zout domain.

Boolean rings and the ring homomorphisms between them form a category BooRng.
R has characteristic 2 (meaning that x+x=0 for all x):2x=4x‚àí2x=4x 2‚àí2x=(2x) 2‚àí2x=2x‚àí2x=0.
Define x‚à®y to mean x+xy+y.
Thus R is a distributive lattice.
Next define ¬¨x to be x+1.
Then: ¬¨x is a pseudocomplement of x (meaning that x(¬¨x)=0):x(¬¨x)=x(x+1)=x 2+x=2x=0.
Then R is a Boolean ring.
In fact, we have: Boolean rings and Boolean algebras are equivalent.
The most common example is the power set P(S) of any set S.
This terminology applied also to Boolean rings, and it changed even more slowly.
This distinction survives most in the terminology of œÉ-rings and œÉ-algebras.
One characteristic property is that the two outer sequences are exact sequences.
This is theorem below.
As usual, we use the following notation.
That other convention has its advanages in the context of unstable cohesion.
Here with stable cohesion the present convention is more natural.
Beware that this is a very general conceptualization of de Rham coefficients.
It may be thought of as an incarnation of the concept of a fracture theorem.
By cohesion the left vertical map is an equivalence.
The claim now follows with the homotopy fiber characterization of homotopy pullbacks.
First we observe that indeed Œ© ‚Ä¢‚â•0‚âÉ‚ô≠ dRE^.

Let again H= Smooth‚àûGrpd.
We abbreviate E conn c‚âîE conn c,0.
Let ‚ÑÇ[b] be the polynomial ring with complex numbers coefficients on a single generator b.

The above examples all take place in the TSmooth‚àûGrpd, modelling higher differential geometry.
In particular, it is an orthogonal Lie algebra.

There are several equivalent ways to set up a model category structure for (2,1)-sheaves.
Write Grpd for the category of small category groupoids and functors between them.
Write Grpd nat for the natural model structure on groupoids.
Then this is a model structure for (2,1)-sheaves on C.
These two model structures are equivalent:
This appears as (Hollander, theorem 5.4).
He is also interested in philosophy and history of mathematics.
, see also (Ando 00, sections II.8, II.9).
(See also below at Properties ‚Äì Relation to conformal blocks).
And that is indeed what G-equivariant elliptic cohomology assigns to the point.
This last statement appears as (Lurie 09, remark 5.2).
On the cohomological side this corresponds to a twist of the cohomology theory.
It essentially amounts to the discussion of diagram (0.0.4 b).
Let G be a compact Lie group.
Write T‚Ü™G for its maximal torus and W for its Weyl group.
Write Orb(G) for the orbit category of G.
So let G be a simple, simply connected compact Lie group.
Regard BG in Smooth‚àûGrpd = Sh ‚àû(SmthMfd).
This is the Hitchin connection.
So we should get an A-(‚àû,1)-module bundle modulated by œá:[B[E,ùîæ m],BG]‚ü∂BGL 1(A).
And that should be the G-‚Äúequivariant‚Äù elliptic cohomology of the point.
This state of affairs is hinted at in (Lurie, section 5.1).
(This statement also appears as (Lurie, remark 5.2)).
(This is what appears as ùíú s in Lurie, middle of p.38).
So there are a priori two A-‚àû-oine bundles on bare homotopy types here.

The representing data œï‚ààUSb,œà‚ààVTa induce a canonical isomorphism œâ:Ua‚Üí‚àºVb.
It is given by the evident composite Ua‚ÜíUŒ∑aUSTa‚Üí‚àºB(Ta,b)‚ÜíSet(VTa,Vb)‚Üíeval œàVb.
With notation as above, put x=œâ¬Ø(y), so x=(Uf)(œï)‚ààUa.
Here then is one key definition.
See Dimov-Tholen, Proposition 2.3, where the proof is sketched.
Thus naturally represented adjoint pairs could be equivalently described as certain types of ambimorphic objects.
Thus each x‚ààUa induces a map ‚àí‚ãÖ Ux:A(a,a)‚ÜíUa.
Similarly, each y‚ààVb induces a map ‚àí‚ãÖ Vy:B(b,b)‚ÜíVb.
The arity of the operation is n.
Sets with finitary operations are called finitary magmas or finitary groupoids.
More generally, a finitary operation in a multicategory is just a multimorphism.
More generally, one could use an arbitrary set instead of a finite set.
However, the generalizations are only definable in closed multicategories, rather than any multicategory.
In low dimensions, the situation can be (and usually is) simplified.
It is defined by any left invariant?
This bilinear form is the moment of inertia.
This appears (Johnstone, p. 225).
See cohesive topos for details.
See (Johnstone).
This is further amplified by the following proposition.
Let X be a locale and ‚Ñ∞‚ÜíSh(X) a geometric morphism.
Conversely, suppose that ‚Ñ∞ has as localic reflection the point.

It is based on some impromptu talks given to a small group of category theorists.
I am no expert on topos theory.
These notes are for people even less expert than me.
Section 1 explains the definition of topos.
The remaining three sections discuss some of the connections between topos theory and other subjects.
Section 2 is on connections between topos theory and set theory.
There are two themes here.
This provides an appealing alternative to ZFC.
This is the story of classifying toposes.
There are elementary toposes and Grothendieck toposes.
Grothendieck toposes are categories of sheaves.
Elementary toposes are slightly more general, and the definition is simpler.
They are what I will emphasize here.
In the category of sets, inverse images are a special case of pullbacks.
Next consider characteristic functions of subsets.
This property of sets can now be stated in purely categorical terms.
We use ‚Ü£ to indicate a mono (= monomorphism = monic).
Let ‚Ñ∞ be a category with finite limits.
To understand this further, we need two lemmas.
In any category, the pullback of a mono is a mono.
So, pulling ùóç:1‚ÜíŒ© back along any map X‚ÜíŒ© gives a mono into X.
Let ‚Ñ∞ be a category and let T‚Ü£ùóçŒ© be a mono in ‚Ñ∞.
Then T is terminal in ‚Ñ∞.
This leads to a second description of subobject classifiers.
Then a subobject classifier is exactly a terminal object of Mono(‚Ñ∞).
Here is a third way of looking at subobject classifiers.
It is a harmless abuse of language, which I will adopt.
Assume also that ‚Ñ∞ has pullbacks.
This defines a functor Sub:‚Ñ∞ op‚ÜíSet.
Now we show that this is equivalent to the original definition.
In other words, it is a subobject classifier.
The primordial topos is Set.
It has special properties not shared by most other toposes.
This is the subject of Section 2.
Its subobject classifier is the set 2 with trivial G-action.
This is the subject of Section 3.
Sheaves will be defined and explained in Section 3.
The category FinSet of finite sets is a topos.
You might ask ‚Äòwhy is the definition of topos what it is?
What‚Äôs the motivation?‚Äô
More spectacularly, the axioms imply that every topos has finite colimits.
But monadic functors create limits, and ‚Ñ∞ has finite limits.
Hence ‚Ñ∞ op has finite limits; that is, ‚Ñ∞ has finite colimits.
It also provides an invaluable insight into topos theory as a whole.
The terminal object 1 is a separator (generator).
It is worth dwelling on what this says.
(We might harmlessly write both f‚àòx and f(x) as fx.)
The property above says that if f(x)=g(x) for all x‚ààX then f=g.
In other words, a function is determined by its effect on elements.
Write 0 for the initial object of Set (the empty set).
Equivalently, Set is not equivalent to the terminal category ùüô.
A topos satisfying properties 1 and 2 is called well-pointed.
What are the ‚Äòthe natural numbers‚Äô, though?
Let ‚Ñ∞ be a category with a terminal object, 1.
Property 3 is, then, that Set has a natural numbers object.
The existence of such splittings is precisely the Axiom of Choice.
But what is this thing called ‚Äòthe category of sets‚Äô?
It is this: we take the properties above as our axioms on sets.
‚ÄòThe‚Äô category of sets is any category satisfying these axioms.
But in fact, ETCS does not depend on the general notion of category.
It can be stated without using the word ‚Äòcategory‚Äô once.
To see this, we need to back up a bit.
People seeing this (or the formal version) often ask certain questions.
What does ‚Äòsome things‚Äô mean?
Do you mean that there is a set of sets?
What exactly is meant by ‚Äòbinary relation‚Äô?
What do you mean, ‚Äòdeemed‚Äô?
To hide behind jargon, ZFC is a first-order theory.
You can do it in about ten axioms.
Here ends the digression.
ZFC axiomatizes sets and membership, whereas ETCS axiomatizes sets and functions.
ZFC is slightly stronger than ETCS.
‚ÄòSlightly‚Äô is meant in a sociological sense.
The technical relationship between ZFC and ETCS is well understood.
See Section 8 of McLarty (2004) for details.
Topos theory therefore provides a different viewpoint on set theory.
A sheaf can similarly be understood as a set varying through space.
This language is called the ‚Äòinternal language‚Äô of the topos.
Such is the case for the internal language.
I will therefore describe the idea in a much more basic setting.
A generalized element of X is simply a map in ‚Ñ∞ with codomain X.
This language of generalized elements is the internal language of the category.
It fits well with ordinary categorical terminology and notation?.
For example, let ‚Ñ∞ be a category with finite products.
The internal language is a massively labour-saving device.
First it has to be stated diagrammatically.
(It seems to need at least ten or so inner diagrams.)
But once you have an elementwise proof, all this effort is unnecessary.
Let X be a topological space.
Write Open(X) for its poset of open subsets.
A presheaf on X is a functor F:Open(X) op‚ÜíSet.
This difference can be captured by asking the following question.
The first example above, with continuous functions, is a sheaf.
The proof can be split into two parts.
This is because boundedness is not a local property.
There is also an abstract categorical explanation of where the concept of sheaf comes from.
Write the equivalence obtained from the adjunction above as Sh(X)‚âÉ‚Üê‚ÜíEt(X).
See Mac Lane and Moerdijk (1994) for details.
One way or another, we have the category Sh(X) of sheaves on X.
Its subobject classifier Œ© is given by Œ©(U)={open subsets of U}.
So the class of topological spaces embeds into the class of toposes.
We can think of toposes as generalized spaces.
For example, suppose you hear someone talking about ‚Äòconnected toposes‚Äô.
The next few subsections are all examples of this generalization process.
So far I have said nothing about maps between toposes.
Such a functor is called a logical morphism.
It can be derived by generalizing from topology.
This is not obvious.
It is a fact that f * preserves finite limits.
So now we know what continuous maps look like in topos-theoretic terms.
We duly generalize: Definition Let ‚Ñ∞ and ‚Ñ± be toposes.
(People often say ‚Äòleft exact left adjoint‚Äô.)
I will write Topos for the category of toposes and geometric morphisms.
(Really it‚Äôs a 2-category, in an obvious way.)
Since f * has a left adjoint, it preserves limits.
Hence (f *,f *) is a geometric morphism ‚ÑÇ^‚Üíùîª^.
It is called sheafification or the associated sheaf functor.
So the inclusion of sheaves into presheaves is a geometric morphism.
In other words, sheafifying a sheaf does not change it.
Let us generalize another concept of topology.
But Sh(1)=Psh(1)=Set, so we make the following definition.
So maybe subtoposes of presheaf toposes are relatively easy too.
They have a special name: Definition
Hence Sh(X) is a Grothendieck topos.
Being Grothendieck is generally thought of as a mild condition on a topos.
Fix a small category ‚ÑÇ.
(There are axioms.)
The following two paragraphs may make it seem easier, or harder.
First, there is an explicit classification of the subtoposes of any topos ‚Ñ∞.
Calling these the ‚Äòcovering sieves‚Äô gives the notion of Grothendieck topology.
I will also explain why topos theorists are fond of jokes about pointless topology.
The idea now is to split the process X‚Ü¶Sh(X) into two steps.
A map of frames is a map preserving order, joins and finite meets.
This gives a functor Open:TopSp‚ÜíFrame op.
We now perform a linguistic manoeuvre.
Frame op is the desired category of ‚Äòpointless spaces‚Äô.
We can wholeheartedly say that a locale is a pointless space.
This is the two-step process mentioned above.
This means that Loc is equivalent to a full subcategory of Topos.
Every locale gives rise to a topos‚Äîbut the converse is also true.
Given a topos ‚Ñ∞, the subobjects of 1 form a poset Sub ‚Ñ∞(1).
Assuming that ‚Ñ∞ has enough colimits, Sub ‚Ñ∞(1) is a frame.
This process defines a functor Topos ‚Üí Loc ‚Ñ∞ ‚Ü¶ Sub ‚Ñ∞(1).
Now a wonderful thing is true.
The functor just defined is left adjoint to the inclusion Sh:Loc‚Ü™Topos.
This means that Loc is (equivalent to) a reflective subcategory of Topos.
Hence the counit is an isomorphism: X‚âÖSub Sh(X)(1) for any locale X.
This is how you recover a locale from its topos of sheaves.
It is reasonable to say that a locale is a special sort of topos.
In that sense, locale theory is the study of truth values.
(This result is due to Street (1981).
‚ÄòAlmost‚Äô refers to a set-theoretic size condition.)
How much has been lost by passing from topological spaces to locales?
In fact, some things are gained.
But it is a theorem that every subgroup of a localic group is closed.
See for instance Section C5.3 of Johnstone (2003).
As mentioned above, every adjunction restricts canonically to an equivalence between full subcategories.
Sobriety amounts to a rather mild separation condition.
For example, every Hausdorff space is sober.
There is a kind of attitudinal paradox here.
In our example, they are the internal groups in ‚Ñ∞.
But there are other ways of looking at such theories.
Consider the free finite product category ùíØ equipped with an internal group.
(There are general reasons why such a thing must exist.)
Concretely, ùíØ looks something like this.
It must contain an object X, the underlying object of the internal group.
This category ùíØ is called the Lawvere theory of groups.
The same goes for rings, lattices, etc.
Some people say that an algebraic theory is just a finite product category.
Others say that algebraic theories correspond to finite product categories.
Terminology aside, we can play the same game for other classes of limit.
In a category with finite limits you can talk about both.
There is a trade-off here.
(You also make more work for yourself.)
(You also increase your fuel costs.)
Take monoidal categories, for instance.
We can speak of internal monoids in any monoidal category.
(This is in fact the category of finite ordinals.)
We might define a monoidal theory to be a small monoidal category.
It is a sketch of the context in which classifying toposes can be understood.
Let ‚Ñ∞ be a topos.
Let R be a commutative ring in ‚Ñ∞.
So, define U‚Ü£R by the factorization f=(P‚Ü†U‚Ü£R).
In other words, it states that the map 1+U‚ÜíR is epi.
Here we have used the fact that every topos has coproducts, written +.
This gives a hint of how the process can be mechanized.
You now have the choice between a short story and a long story.
These are called logical morphisms.
The more popular notion of map of toposes is that of geometric morphism.
The corresponding theories are the geometric theories.
Every geometric theory has a classifying topos.
There are two surprises here.
The bigger surprise is the reversal of direction.
As the name suggests, the choice that society made was motivated by geometry.
(This is an aspect of the thought that geometry is dual to algebra.)
Some familiar topological spaces can be construed as classifying toposes.
We will need the notion of finite presentability.
Finite presentability is a more categorical concept than it might seem.
This formulation of finite presentability in Grp uses the free group functor F.
I will not go into this.
As promised, the classifying topos for groups is easy to describe:
The classifying topos for groups is Set Grp fp.
The same goes for other algebraic theories.
This yields something interesting even for very trivial theories.
Hence for any topos ‚Ñ∞, objects of ‚Ñ∞ correspond to geometric morphisms ‚Ñ∞‚ÜíSet FinSet.
The topos Set FinSet is therefore called the object classifier.
There are clean answers to this reversed question for many toposes ùíØ.
Here I will just tell you the answer for a smaller class of toposes.
Then the presheaf topos ‚ÑÇ^ classifies finite-limit-preserving functors out of ‚ÑÇ.
This is one version of Diaconescu's Theorem.)
In many cases, this translation is surprisingly straightforward.

Finite coproducts are van Kampen colimits.
All small coproducts are van Kampen colimits.
Extensive categories are also called positive categories, especially if they are also coherent.
Note that any disjoint coproduct in a coherent category is automatically pullback-stable.
A positive coherent category which is also exact is called a pretopos.
If an extensive category also has finite limits, it is called lextensive or disjunctive.
See familial regularity and exactness for a generalization of extensivity and its relationship to exactness.
Any extensive category with finite products is automatically a distributive category.
We call this the extensive coverage or extensive topology.
The codomain fibration of any extensive category is a stack for its extensive topology.
See superextensive site for more details.
Regular/exact categories have quotients of (some) congruences.
Similarly, pre-/lextensive categories have disjoint unions.

Another useful fact is that any extensive category with finite products is distributive.
The definition given below combines elements from the work of all three.
And why should we expect everything to be enriched in higher groupoids anyway?
A priori this may seem arbitrary (although it certainly works very well).
How can we even correctly formulate such a question?
Thus, a prederivator is a ‚ÄúCat-valued presheaf‚Äù on Dia.
There are two main motivating examples.
This defines an embedding of Cat into PDer.
A derivator is a prederivator D which satisfies a list of axioms.
These axioms are of two sorts.
Specifically, we require the following.
Intuitively, this says that the Kan extensions in question are pointwise.
The second set of axioms are ‚Äúsheaf‚Äù conditions.
But we do need some sheaf-like properties in order to do category theory.
They can also be understood as 2-categorical sketch conditions.
Sometimes we require this only for finite coproducts.
In particular, we have D(‚àÖ)=1. (Der2)
For any X‚ààDia, consider the family of functors x:1‚ÜíX determined by the objects of X.
There is substantial variation in (Der5).
Thus the derivator encodes the notions of homotopy colimit and of homotopy limit.
We have a dual notion of pointwise right extension.
Clearly a semiderivator is a derivator just when it is both complete and cocomplete.
This means that homotopy colimits of constant diagrams of shapes I and J are equivalent.
This was proven by Heller using the canonical enrichment of any derivator over ‚àû-groupoids.
Hence g * is also fully faithful and so g is a D-equivalence.
The other case is dual.
Let W D denote the class of D-equivalences in Dia.
Since Œ¶ inverts D-equivalences, it factors through Dia[W D ‚àí1].
For any D, the class of D-equivalences is a basic localizer.
Saturation gives 2-out-of-3 property and closure under retracts.
By (Der2) it suffices to check this for any c‚ààC.
Thus, the derivator axioms say that all comma squares are exact.
Specifically, we have f=sr and g=tr.
But this says exactly that r is a D-equivalence.
‚ÄúIf‚Äù follows directly from Theorem and the previous theorem.
Example applications can be found at homotopy exact square.
We can consider now the 2-category of derivators.
Let us write Der ! for the 2-category whose morphisms preserve colimits.
Then one may guess that some notion of higher groupoid might do the job.
Axiom Der 5 is discussed in Theorem 9.8.5 in (Radulescu Banu).
We define the homotopy prederivator of C by Ho(C)(X)=Ho(C X).
A proof of this is sketched in GPS, Example 2.5.
For instance, see Remark 5.4 and Example 5.5 in Lagkas-Nikolos.
This is shown in (Renaudin 2006).
See at Ho(CombModCat) for more.
However, an actual proof of this seems to be missing.
The term derivator is originally due to Grothendieck, introduced in Pursuing Stacks .
This property no longer holds for condensed ‚àû-groupoids, and hypercovers are now necessary.

A direct treatment would involve higher order jet bundles [22].

As a polygon the square is the regular 4-gon.
The identification of opposite sides of the square yields the cylinder and the torus.
And the identification with opposite orientation yields the M√∂bius strip.

There are two well known examples of such systems:
Kedlaya and Lauder-Wan also studied the Dwork approach from a computational viewpoint.
It may also be interesting to develop a notion of global Fourier transform?.
The constraints on such a theory would be the following:
This also means that these propositions may be very hard to implement in practice.

Proposition Every semiadditive monoidal category is a CMon-enriched monoidal category.
In a full (‚àû,1)-category theoretic context this appears as HTT, def. 5.5.8.8.
The introduction of that article lists further and older occurences of this definition.
Let C be an (‚àû,1)-category with finite products.
So in particular it is a locally presentable (‚àû,1)-category.
Alg (inft) is a compactly generated (‚àû,1)-category.
This is HTT, prop. 5.5.8.10.
There is a model category structure on these (see there).
See model structure on simplicial T-algebras.
This is due to (Quillen).
This is due to (Bergner).
A comprehensive statement of these facts is in HTT, section 5.5.9.
We may regard T as an (‚àû,1)-category and consider its (‚àû,1)-algebras.

This is subsumed by treating interpretations as functors out of syntactic categories.

A preframe map is a poset map that preserves finite meets and directed joins.
A frame is a fortiori a preframe.
Then X is compact iff œá ‚ä§ is a preframe map.
The following proposition is easily checked.
Before giving the proof, we might as well say where it comes from.
Call this preframe map h.
Thus we have shown h=œá ‚ä§ X‚äóY is a preframe map.
This way rational homotopy theory connects homotopy theory and differential graded algebra.
See this remark at model structure for L-‚àû algebras.)
Rational homotopy theory is mostly restricted to simply connected topological spaces.
This is due to (Serre 53).
Still, it follows the same general pattern.
See differential forms on presheaves for more.
Recall that by the homotopy hypothesis theorem, Top is equivalent to sSet.
Therefore set in the above C‚âîŒî.

We discuss the definition of polynomial differential forms on topological spaces in more detail.
Explicitly this means the following.
This is a smooth manifold diffeomorphic to the Cartesian space ‚Ñù n.
This is the dg-algebra of polynomial differential forms.
(See remark below for what this means.)
In particular this means that A=(‚àß ‚Ä¢,d) is a semifree dgc-algebra.
Minimal Sullivan models (def. ) are unique up to isomorphism.
For full exposition see at geometry of physics ‚Äì homotopy types.

Of course this is an extremely general notion of spaces modeled on C.
It should be C(X,U):=Hom Spaces S(X,U).
This defines a covariant functor C(X):=Hom Spaces S(X,‚àí):S‚ÜíSets.
Lawvere refers to this adjoint pair as Isbell conjugation.
Let V be a symmetric monoidal category and C a V-enriched category.

More generally, whenever the underlying-set functor V(I,‚àí):V‚ÜíSet is conservative.
However, the converse is false in general.
Recall the following properties of a Borel measure Œº on a Hausdorff topological space:
Œº is inner regular on some Borel subset B if Œº(B)=sup{Œº(K)‚à£K‚äÇBandKiscompact}.
Equivalently, one can simply say that m(B)=sup{M(B‚Ä≤)‚à£B‚Ä≤‚äÇB,M(B‚Ä≤)isfinite,B‚Ä≤isBorel}.
We give three equivalent definitions of Radon measures.
In order to pass from m to M, set M(B)=inf{m(V)‚à£V‚äÉBandVisopen}.
A Radon measure is œÉ-finite if m is œÉ-finite.
A Radon measure is moderated if M is œÉ-finite.
Suppose X is a locally compact Hausdorff topological space.
(For œÉ-finite spaces we have Œº *=Œº *¬Ø.)
For example, continuous maps are Lusin Œº-measurable for any Œº.
Lusin Œº-measurable maps form a sheaf with respect to X.
Step functions and lower semicontinuous maps are always Lusin Œº-measurable.
Suppose H:X‚ÜíY is a Œº-proper map.
The pushforward measure H *Œº is a Radon measure on Y defined as follows.
This yields a Radon measure m on Y.
A Radon measure on a Hausdorff space is œÑ-additive.
The converse is true on a compact Hausdorff space.
Radon probability measures on compact Hausdorff spaces form a monad: the Radon monad.
(See also monads of probability, measures and valuations.)
Most measures of interest in geometry are Radon.
The result is a pretriangulated dg-category.
The dg-category D(T) is pretriangulated.
Syntomic cohomology is the abelian sheaf cohomology of the syntomic site of a scheme.
It is a p-adic analogue of Deligne-Beilinson cohomology.
The syntomic cohomology may also be obtained from prismatic cohomology (Bhatt22).
It has an action of the Frobenius morphism œï.
This leads to the following definition.
We will refer to an object classifier satisfying (2) above as a universe.
Specifically, (r,r‚Ä≤) is the kernel pair of i.
Dually, j is monic.
Finally, since 0 is a strict initial object, 0‚ÜíS is monic.

In particular, we have ‚Äúuniverse cumulativity‚Äù: Corollary
This is almost right, but it is not 0-truncated.
To be precise Corollary 2.31 in the paper gives the following construction:
Further, examples for the specific case of filter products are constructed.

We have already, trivially, generalized the cross product to other ground fields.
In dimension 7, there are uncountably many binary cross products.
In any other finite dimension, there are no binary cross products at all.
Binary cross products are closely related to normed division algebras (NDAs).
(See also volume form.)
In 3 dimensions, this also recovers the classical cross product.
If 4‚â§k<n‚àí1, then there are no cross products.
If k=n, then there are no cross products.
If k‚â•n+1, then there is one cross product (always 0).
In general, this produces the binary (n‚àí2)-vector-valued cross product.
